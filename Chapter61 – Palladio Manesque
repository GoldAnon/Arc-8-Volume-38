*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――Palladio Manesque, was one of the princes who competed with the 77th Emperor of the Vollachian Empire, Vincent Vollacha, in the Imperial Selection Ceremony.

In the 77th Imperial Selection Ceremony which was one of even fiercer competition compared to past selections, he had allied himself with the deemed forerunner Lamia Godwin, and had nearly cornered Vincent Abellux, who at the time had not yet assumed the throne, and Prisca Benedict.

Ultimately, Palladio's abilities were viewed as a threat, and being impeded by the colluding Vincent and Prisca, he was forced to withdraw from the Imperial Selection Ceremony, however Palladio himself was not at fault for his defeat.

It was because Lamia, with whom he had formed an alliance, had been taken down prematurely, resulting in a fatal alteration in the course of the Imperial Selection Ceremony unbeknownst to Palladio, that led to his defeat.

Palladio: [Truly, was she not was just a hopeless younger sister solely proficient at lip service]

Having already lost their existence, in a way that proved she was all bark and no bite, that was Lamia.  

When Lamia attacked the fleeing dragon carriages from the Imperial Capital, Palladio had also lent his aid upon her request. And yet, Lamia pitifully lost and met her demise. Both in life and in death, she was nothing but a foolish sister who left behind no accomplishments worthy of her grandiose words.

Sneering at Lamia's disgraceful behavior, Palladio, with eyes that bore witness to his undead nature――including a third eye on his forehead, narrowed his three eyes and fixed his gaze upon the battlefield.

On the battlefield before him, an immense number of undead marched forward in ranks, armed with endless lives and a deep rooted obsession to capture the city that was their target, relentlessly continuing their resolute and repulsive attacks.

Commanding these undead that blanketed the vast lands, and capturing the city in question――the Fortified City Garkla, and thus destroying once and for all the Vollachian Empire that had been misguided to this day, that was Palladio’s duty.

That, was the duty bestowed upon him as one chosen by the heavens.

――Palladio is a descendant of the Evil Eye tribe, a race blessed by the world.

Said to have guided the mediocre human race with their special powers in ancient times, as a race favored by the heavens, the Divine Protection, which is a gift granted to a select few, was bestowed upon every descendant of the Evil Eye tribe.

However, the Evil Eye tribe was feared by the people for their superior powers, and was also an unfortunate race that had been driven out from taking the center stage in history――Palladio had a mission to save his fellow tribesmen who had fallen into a world of suffering.

It cannot not remain without being proven. That the Evil Eye Tribe is the most preeminent race in the world.

For that reason――,

Palladio: [This empire built by cowards like you two, I will destroy and rebuild it]

Running his fingers through his undulating green hair, within the mind of Paladio whose undead visage had distorted, was the aggravating image of both Vincent and Prisca. 

In violation of the unwritten rule of the Imperial Selection Ceremony that only a single individual can survive, for the ignoble nature of the two who had colluded to survive together, as a member of the same Vollachian royal family, he had nothing but contempt. At this rate, it would not be surprising that, even during the Imperial Selection Ceremony, there had been dastardly attempts to trample upon the long history of the Vollachian Empire and its weight. ――No, rather, it would only be natural to assume that some kind of conspiracy was at play.

Palladio : [Indeed, why else would I have fallen behind the likes of you and your ilk.]

Being a descendant of the Evil Eye Tribe that was heaven’s chosen, utilizing that extraordinary talent, Palladio had swept aside all enemies and established his position as a prince of Vollachia.

He, who upheld the Empire's iron-blooded code above all else, could never be inferior to weaklings who only engage in collusion and schemes.

Therefore――,

Palladio : [――Vincent and Prisca, both of you are condemned]

And thus, once the Vollachian Empire is flattened into its ideal form, Palladio who possesses the lineage and qualities befitting a ruler would rule over it.

As for the manner of his rule, it would be modeled after the one Palladio has long regarded as the greatest emperor of all time, the one who ruled the Vollachian Empire with pain and fear, the Emperor of the Briar――Eugard Vollachia.

Making the Emperor’s authority known far and wide, the regency of Eugard who is said to have bound the hearts of his own people with thorns, was precisely Palladio’s ideal.

In later works of fiction, there are accounts of foolish rumors about the Emperor of the Briar living for the love of a mere village girl; upon Palladio ascension to the throne, all of those would be burned and buried.

The basis for Palladio's confidence, of course, lies in the ability Palladio received from the Evil Eye Tribe that forms the core of his unique nature, an extraordinary ability.

Palladio : [――――]

He closed both eyes, and focused his attention on the third eye upon his forehead, his Evil Eye.

Instantly, Palladio's field of vision was no longer a narrow view of the battlefield in front of him, but a vast heavenly eye that grasped the vast space of the surrounding area in its entirety.

It is truly the viewpoint of the sun――Palladio's third eye integrates his own field of vision with the sun, providing the perspective of a ruler looking down upon the world at large.

Making use of it, Palladio fulfilled his role as commander of the undead army with dignity.

Ordinary individuals might boast that they could win by brute force with the inexhaustible forces of the undead, but employing such poor tactics to force their way through is not a battle befitting an emperor.

Bringing the opponent to their knees by means of both force and ingenuity, such is the true embodiment of the iron-blooded code of Vollachia.

Palladio: [You have prepared suitable experts and have made ample provisions, it is apparent that you happen to be blessed with subordinates…after all, it seems that is your limit, Vincent.]

The coordinated attack between the soldiers stationed on the walls and the powerful troops that charged forward was impressive, and the undead, despite their superior numbers, were unable to breach even the first layer of Fortified City's defenses. However, the fact that they were using some of the highest quality cards in their hand so early was nothing but a sign of insecurity about their fighting strength.

After all, Palladio’s Evil Eye which could see through to the city’s interior――had ascertained that most of the occupants were refugees who fled from the Imperial Capital and various towns and villages, and without having the power to fight they were simply a hindrance.

From their standpoint, defending the thickest and largest walls was the only thread they could cling to.

Palladio: [I shall teach those ignorant fools who do not realize that this is nothing more than a fragile and fleeting illusion. ――You people, the world you see through your eyes is so narrow that I pity you.]

Scoffing at such foolish resistance, Palladio held up his hand and sent his voice to a distant location.

This also, was Palladio's innate power as a member of the Evil Eye Tribe――telepathic communication, which allowed him to project his voice to the person whose hair, nails, or body parts he has taken, regardless of the distance that separated them.

With that, Palladio made the decisive move that would end the Fortified City.

That being――,

Palladio: [――Release the hoard of corpse flying dragons. To those who focus only upon the walls, I shall teach you all about how an emperor wages war.]

△▼△▼△▼△

???: [――The enemy’s flying dragon squadron has crossed the great mountain behind the grand fortress and entered the sky above! Right now, the enemy soldiers are being dropped in and the undead have invaded the city!]

The messenger who came racing into the command room reported the change of situation between pants and breaths.

The walled fortress had been suffering from simple yet powerful brute force attacks, but now the opponent had decided to attack from the air, the largest weak point in Garkla.

Gouged out of a mighty mountainside, the city’s greatest fortress could be boasted to have a robustness that would not easily be defeated even if the ramparts surrounding the city were breached. However, the sky was the one place where it was defenseless.

Serena: [Just when the situation has become worrying, you make your move. This tactic, as I assumed, is probably directed by His Excellency Palladio Manesque.]

Otto: [The Prince of Vollachia, who competed with His Excellency the Emperor in the Imperial Selection Ceremony?]

Otto muttered to Serena, who frowned at the report and traced the white sword wound on her face with her finger.

Among the opponents who had joined the undead side, he was named as a target to be wary of in advance. He was a rare person with a unique ability that came from the Evil Eye tribe, and his nature was both sadistic and ruthless.

It is not easy to handle an opponent who concentrates all of their strength into one’s defenseless blind spot, but it is a common war strategy.

Especially in siege warfare, a small hole can often bring about destruction.

On such a large scale, it would be fatal to have such a hole created.

Therefore――,

Otto: [Just like the theory.]

Serena: [――? Theori?]

Otto: [Nevermind, don’t worry about it. More importantly…]

Serena tilted her head at the unfamiliar sound, waved her hand lightly, and then Otto gave a nod of approval to Berstetz in the center of the room to send instructions to the messenger.

In response, Berstetz's thread-like eyes slightly opened,

Berstetz: [Give them the order. ――It’s time for the Special Forces.]

 He was able to use words that were not familiar to him in an appropriate manner.

△▼△▼△▼△

――That ought to have been an arrow fired as the decisive blow in the battle for the Fortified City of Garkla.

The utility of flying dragon riders was common knowledge that went without saying for the people of the Empire, but when applying the condition of the undead, it was something that could only be accomplished provided that both rider and flying dragon were resurrected.

Fulfilling that prerequisite, the undead flying dragon riders contributing to the undead forces were few in number. Therefore, they had been handled carefully, naught else but upon the scene where their involvement was utmost critical.

Palladio: [――The undead flying dragons are to be deployed at once. To those fools who focus all of their efforts on the city walls, we shall teach the methods by which a true Emperor wages war.]

From the commanding officer of the hosts of undead, an order was sent out through telepathy.

Obeying the strange voice that seemed to directly echo within their heads, the few undead flying dragon riders took their undead flying dragons along with thim, and seized the skies of the Fortified City with the flaps of their beloved dragons’ wings.

Towering over the back of the Fortified City, surmounting the height of the great mountain which served as the national border with neighboring countries, was a life-threatening act, no matter how skilled of flying dragon riders they were. Disregarding that greatest obstacle of risking their lives, the undead flying dragon riders accomplish the objective of their operation.

Undead Flying Dragon Riders: [――――]

Below the golden glow of their undead eyes, the great fortress protected by a robust wall built of stone could be seen.

Deployed there was a dragonship carried by nearly a hundred undead flying dragons, and the unruly group of undead boarding it.

The ones in charge of transport were undead, and thus the ones being deployed were also undead―― it was a blasphemous tactic, one that cared naught for survival.

???: [Go.]

Receiving a brief command, the neighing undead flying dragons lowered the dragonship upon that place.

It was an act of barbarity that took no account their speed or position of landing, one that would be more appropriately titled being casted off; in order to deliver a fatal blow to the Vollachian Empire, it revolved and revolved as it approached the city’s center.

And then――,

???: [IN OUR CAPACITIES, WE ARE THE――!!]

???: [STRONGEST! STRONGEST! STRONGEST――!!]

The group that had jumped out like a tempest from the mountainside stormed the flank of the plummeting dragonship, and from the inside out, pulverized the fatal blow upon the Imperial Soldiers to smithereens.

△▼△▼△▼△

――Appointed as “Special Forces”, the time they spent waiting was tantalizing, despite the heavy responsibility.

However, even though it was tantalizing, there was no fear that their efforts would amount to a swing and miss.

That was because Natsuki Schwartz was a man who had already won over the trust of Gustav Morello.

Unconditionally assisting in the things that he had decided, believing in the events that he was convinced would occur without any basis, Gustav had resolved himself to fight, to the best of his ability, against any enemy whom he had declared they would oppose.

Therefore, ever since the battle surrounding the Fortified City had commenced, while feeling the hard efforts of the members of the Pleiades Battalion aside from themselves unfolding, they patiently awaited their time.

But then again, the act of waiting, and being unbothered by waiting, were different matters.

Gustav: [OHHHH――!]

With a powerful bellow, Gustav swung about his four arms, and rampaged as he pleased atop the plummeting dragonship.

The undead on the dragonship had thrust their weapons into the vessel, securing their bodies in place so as to not be thrown off. Because of that, their response to the surprise attack of Gustav’s squad had been delayed.

Forming the “Special Forces” together with Gustav, were not Subaru’s personal guards of Hiain, Weitz, and Idra, but rather the veteran gladiators who had spent a long time on the Gladiator Island―― that was to say, they were individuals with whom Gustav was well acquainted. 

As Governor of Ginunhive, it was Gustav’s duty to administer the Gladiator Island without a hitch, and he had a better grasp of the gladiator’s abilities than they themselves did.

Though, he had never thought that this kind of service would fall under his duties as Governor.

Gladiator: [To think they’d send rabbits in order to kill wolves.]

Gladiator: [We’re the wind, ‘n ain’t nobody can fuckin’ surround the wind!]

Gladiator: [Kuhahahaha! It’s a brawl, a brawl’s surely brewin’ I tell ya! Stakin’ my life really gets me fuckin’ goin’~!!]

Hot-headed yet capable individuals such as the lone-wolf Jawsrough, Phenmelle, and Milzac, wielded their weapons together with Gustav upon the dragonship, and subjugated the undead one after another.

The mysterious phenomenon of raised fighting spirit surrounding the Pleiades Battalion allowed the gladiators versed in battle to be deployed against powerful fighters with many years of military experiences, and sufficiently display their strength even in the poor situation of a plummeting dragonship. ――Nay, it was rather the situation upon which their lives were staked, which had allowed them to display abilities that exceeded even their true strength. 

???: [That is exactly why selecting the suicide squad… no, why selecting the “Special Forces” is effective.]

On this battlefield, the duty of Gustav’s squad had an equal, if not greater danger to their lives than those holding back the swarms of undead on the front lines.

They were entrusted with such an important task, however, Gustav’s squad absolutely must not die.

To not let even a single one of them die, they were under strict orders from the Boss of the Pleiades Battalion.

Gustav: [As the official, I do not deem it acceptable to serve two masters. Therefore, I do not look up to you as my master, but… the earnest request of a friend, is something I wish to undertake to the best of my capacity.]

Saying that, Gustav grabbed the heads of the undead whom had pulled out their weapons, and were moving to counterattack, and smashed the four bodies together above his head, shattering them.

Scattering the earthen remains as their crumbling resounded, he immediately grabbed the next enemies.

Gustav hated the violent and savage temperment of the Multi-Arm Tribe very much.

As much as he could, he regulated his own heart, and, not wanting to surrender himself to belligerence or anger, he had intended on living a life with firm restrictions upon himself.

In this Vollachian Empire, while serving as Governor of the Gladiator Island, he had maintained his principles.

Gustav: [Oh, OHHHHHHHHHHH――!!!]

Those principles of his, in this moment, Gustav completely forgot about them all.

At that moment, in which he rampaged with the temperament of the Multi-Arm Tribe he thought to be vexing,

For that reason――,

Gustav: [IN OUR CAPACITIES, WE ARE――!!]

Special Forces: [INVINCIBLE! INVINCIBLE! INVINCIBLE――!!]

Gustav and the rest of the “Special Forces” carried out their special directive.

After all, it was precisely that uproar of heat that served as greater proof than anything else that Schwartz and his battalion were fighting hard for the sake of the Empire’s triumph.

△▼△▼△▼△

By drawing attention to the quantity or outstanding strength of his forces, he can then play his trump card in key areas that have become thin on the ground.
 
If successfully implemented, Palladio Manesque's plan would have shattered the city's defensive measures and certainly would have been the decisive factor in the outcome of the siege.
 
However, that is only if things have been successfully fitted together.

???: [When they deploy the undead, the first thing to think about is tactics that will take advantage of their characteristics. It is inevitable that they will try to cross Mount Gildray in a way that makes them willing to die.]

???: [When this idea of a wall that can not be pushed through by sheer force is presented, it is natural to want to play your cards when the sky is empty.]

???: [However, I was not expecting it to turn out this way.]

A "Special Force" was deployed to intercept the undead assault force that had targeted the city from the sky, and the command post nodded in agreement as they prevented the attack, which would have been a winning strategy from their opponents' point of view.
 
As stated previously, it was an appropriate strategy for the undead to use. However, in terms of taking advantage of the unfortunate situation, it is a strategy that is too straightforward and orthodox.
 
Direct attacks are standard methods and are effective when they work, but they are easily countered.

???: [According to what I have heard, his death during the Imperial Selection Ceremony was also due to his excessive focus on the right way of attack. For better or worse, the time of the undead has stood still.]

Serena described her opponent, who had sent out his own flying dragon squadron to destroy the undead "flying dragon riders" that had appeared in the sky, as having failed to read her plan.
 
It is true that Palladio Manesque was considered to be the opposing commander, and his name was mentioned as a target to be on the lookout for―― but that is if he were to assist others by taking advantage of his Evil Eye tribe characteristics.
 
In fact, Lamia Godwin's raid on the coupled dragon carriages nearly destroyed the empire because of Palladio's assistance.
 
However, it was a silver lining amidst misfortune that the opposing party remained unaware of how to utilize their abilities to the fullest extent.

Serena: [It seems as if His Excellency Palladio is saying that you can never lose a bet if you can see your opponent's hand.]

???: [Normally, if you could see your opponent's hand, you would have a significant advantage.]

Serena: [Really? I could make a bet with you on the same terms. The only thing is, if you play with me, your family will be in danger.]

???: [That is why they call it the Vollachian way!]

Serena: [Being greedy for victory is a virtue. ――You're the same as I am, aren't you?]

Otto's face was truly bitter at the look in Serena's eyes, as if to suggest he had bad character.
 
At any rate, it can be said that in terms of quality of the command post, they have surpassed their opponent. Having destroyed their winning strategy, the enemy will have no choice but to take the next step.
 
And that was――,

Serena: [He’s playing his best trump card. ――The continuous deployment of forces is the flower of a losing battle.]

△▼△▼△▼△

???: [――――KRUUUUUUUAGH!!]

With a thunderous roar that shattered the sky, a three-headed Dragon clad in black scales soared.

With the Blight Dragon’s wings outstretched, it soared over the army of the undead whilst being hit by countless arrows fired at it, but it did not even flinch.

The formidable Three-Headed Valgren, once slain by The Admirer, represented a threat unmatched by any other undead and was indeed the trump card of the undead army. 

After the failure of the surprise attack over Mount Gildray, their commander was correct in his judgment that if he did not immediately try to regroup, they would be overwhelmed at once.

――However, that too was not a direct attack.

???: [Haaah――!]

With a brave voice, the Blight Dragon, outstretching its wings, was furiously attacked by Kafma Irulux―― an immense thorn that rose from the city's walls into the sky.

Kafma's suppressive ability to single-handedly uphold a front full of undead as far as the eye can see entangled Valgren's entire body, binding his wings before they were torn apart.

Of course, it was only a matter of time before the thorns would be torn to shreds by the Blight Dragon's physical strength.

Kafma: [But my responsibility is this one second!]

Whilst blood spilled from his nose and veins bulged all over his body, Kafma challenged Valgren in the sky with a fierce expression on his face.
 
The Blight Dragon twisted its three heads and howled as if angered by the declaration from such a diminutive existence.

The Dragon's roar made all life yield―― however, no fools on this battlefield would dare cower before the Blight Dragon's cries.

???: [――Al Clauseria.]

Valgren, entangled by thorns, stopped moving in mid-air as a rainbow aurora of light shot diagonally across the sky, aiming at one of the Blight Dragon's writhing necks.
 
It vividly caught Valgren's right neck and blew it away at the base.

It was graceful, magnificent, and dazzling; among the finest of magical blows.

???: [Take aim!]

Next, the eyes of the remaining Blight Dragon's heads are pierced by an arrow of lightning speed.

Although the target was small compared to the huge body of the Blight Dragon, the chieftain of the People of Shudraq turned around and sharply called out to the two by her side, who successfully hit the target.

Among the two who were called upon to do so, one sighted the target and the other used her entire body to draw a huge bow that would take ten regular people to pull.

???: [Just… Shoot it!!]

???: [Blast it away~!!]

The two of them combined their efforts to use the powerful bow, and with a loud, star-piercing sound, they hit the head of the blinded Blight Dragon. It was blasted from the chin up, as it turned its two necks into a single head from its original three.

Valgren: [――――KRAAAAAUGH!!]

On top of that, missing two heads on either side, Valgren raised its large head to the sky as it created tremendous heat inside its dark scaled form.

The breath of destruction, so synonymous with Dragons, was directed at the Fortified City below. ――At that moment, the mad Blight Dragon's eyes met the eyes of someone watching it from inside the great fortress that was about to fall.

As that someone stood by that window, they aimed their hand at the Blight Dragon that tore the thorns apart in the sky, and then――,

???: [――El Fula.]

One does not need fancy magic or uncommon monstrous strength if their goal can be accomplished with minimal effort.
 
With precision, which was a model for such things, the blade of the wind cut off the last head left on the Blight Dragon with unrelenting sharpness.

Valgren: [――――]

Each of the three heads was dropped, and the Blight Dragon fell.
 
This was the trump card played by the undead side, the three-headed Valgren, and it was a disappointing defeat.

△▼△▼△▼△

Palladio: [Impossible, impossible impossible impossible impossible impossible impossible impossible impossible…!]

His body trembling all over, while scratching at his hair, Palladio could not accept the defeat of Valgren which he had just witnessed occur through his Evil Eye.

Things that should have been impossible, continued to occur one after another.

Because of that, Palladio fell from what was an overwhelmingly advantageous position, 

Palladio: [How!? How have they seen through all of mine plans!]

The surprise tactic of having the undead flying dragon riders carry a dragonship and cross over the mountain, was perfect.

He was not certain if that had been anticipated, or if it had been preserved fighting assets that immediately reacted to it, but the surprise tactic had been thwarted. Only, that was neither unpleasant nor fatal. ――Rather, it ought not have been.

Palladio: [What even is the Blight Dragon, THE THREE-HEADED…!]

The Three-Headed, Valgren, had immediately been sent out as a harbinger of despair―― in the past, it had exerted tyranny in the accursed neighboring nation, the Kingdom of Lugunica, the resurrected fearsome Blight Dragon.

If that Dragon of forgone mind could display its true worth, domination through means of might and fear would have been accomplished.

To think that the mighty Valgren would be subjugated in such a manner, with its three heads lopped off.

Palladio: [Why are the lot of you all so asinine!? Why be you unable to fulfill the duties expected of mine limbs!?]

The fallen Blight Dragon, the failed Ambush Corps, the swarms of undead still having trouble in conquering the first wall, each of them had failed to provide utility to Palladio, a cluster of fools who only continued to drag down on his legs.

Come to think of it, Vincent, Prisca, and Lamia all had competent servants in their service.

In other words, the difference between Palladio, Vincent, and the rest, came down to whether they were blessed with servants or not. That had nothing to do with the strength of the person in question, and was naught more than external decorations.

Flaunting that, they were a shameless bunch unworthy of being a part of the Imperial Family attempting to outrival Palladio.

Palladio: [The Emperor of the Briar’s solitary nature is the unmistakable true desire of Vollachian Emperor. I shall never stoop to the methods of you cowardly lot…!]

Even in the past Imperial Selection Ceremony, Vincent avoided the stratagem that Palladio had formulated, and he had outsmarted Palladio, snatching victory through such means.

The same thing was happening again. ――Palladio could not overlook such an outrageous act.

Palladio: [Anybody, offer up a suggestion! As of now, I shall enact anything!]

While burning with humiliation, Palladio loudly called out in the undead encampment.

In truth, Palladio had wished to persist as a solitary Emperor who asked not for the likes of others’ opinions. But, the opponent had taken advantage of Palladio’s haughtiness, wielding a spear of malice.

In that case, Palladio had no choice but to display the might of the Emperor through severity.

Palladio: [Is anyone there!? Raise your voice! Or else…]

???: [――Well then, with your permission.]

Turning his head, Palladio looked over the personnel of poor complexion, and a single person raised their voice.

At a glance, that was a slender figure slowly walking through the crowd of undead―― witnessing the aura that was peculiarly different among the other undead, Palladio narrowed his three eyes.

Their appearance clearly set them apart from mediocrity. The only thing remaining was whether their abilities would match that impression or not.

Palladio: [What are you capable of doing?]

???: [Hm, that is right… First of all, how about I show you.]

Saying thus, the white-haired woman standing before Palladio smiled, and held her hand up towards the sky.

And then――,

△▼△▼△▼△

???: [――Ana!!]

When the anticipated Three-Headed evil dragon, having its three heads severed in the sky above the city and crashed to the ground, with its black colossal body disintegrating to dust, there appeared a sense of relief washed over the heart of Anastasia.

Although it was to be expected, the fact that the opponent was formidable remained unchanged.

Even with adequate preparations, there was always the possibility that the enemy could surpass or outflank them. To have avoided that and defeated a formidable foe brought a sense of relief to her.

But that relief of Anastasia was cut short by the voice of Echidna at her neck.

Anastasia: [――――]

Usually remaining motionless masqueraded as Anastasia's scarf, Echidna, the Spirit whom she had known for ten years, bounced up on her shoulder, staring with her black eyes at the sky above the great fortress.

Following Echidna's gaze, Anastasia widened her blue green eyes.

Anastasia: [Is that, stars…?]

Her murmured words sounded uncertain, a manifestation of her lack of confidence.

At the very least, one could say that it was a sight Anastasia had never seen in her lifetime, a spectacle she had not even imagined.

Higher than the flock of undead flying dragons that crossed Mount Gildray, even higher than the Three-Headed evil dragon that ascended above them, lights poured down onto the city from above―― the stars were falling.

While Anastasia marveled at this extraordinary sight, alongside Otto and Berstetz who were left speechless, Serena, witnessing the same scene, laughed, contorting the sword wound on her face,

Serena: [The atmosphere has changed. ――Win or lose, it's coming down to the wire.]

△▼△▼△▼△

Palladio: [Haha, hahahaha! Excellent, yes, this is it! The sight I desired!]

Watching the scene unfolding in the skies of the battlefield, Palladio broke in an ecstatic dance.

The defenses of the Fortified City would be for naught once the cascading light reached the ground. The resistance of those tiny imbeciles would be nothing but dust before the light of the stars.

Palladio: [Well done for approaching me! I shall add you to my vassals! Which name do you wish to be called!]

With delight shimmering in his three golden eyes, Palladio questioned the white-haired woman who had created the phenomenon. Turning to face him following his query, the woman, caught in his gaze once again, had caused Palladio to catch his breath.

Her beautiful white hair with a flawlessly chiseled face, which sent shivers down his spine; and above all else, any noticeable trait an undead might possess which could distinguish it from a regular individual, was absent from her face and eyes. ――An appearance that could be mistaken for that of a living being.

But then, why would she ally herself with him?

When Palladio questioned this, the woman lowered her hips deeply and bowed.

And then, she granted the answer to his question. ――To introduce herself.

???: [It is a tricky position to know what is the right name to use. So for now, simply call me… the Witch of Greed.]
