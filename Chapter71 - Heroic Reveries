*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――Let us assert one thing here.

It was a fact that without Emilia's decisive action, the plan of the Witch, Sphinx, would have come to fruition and the downfall of the Vollachian Empire would have been unavoidable.

Moreover, it was something that no one other than Emilia could have stopped.

Emilia: [――Yah!]

Emilia released a sharp exhale, strained her cheeks, and stood firm against the heat rays of light and the balls of light that came in from all directions, repelling all with her polished ice armaments.

In front of her, the replica of Echidna, Sphinx's magic was all too astonishing, and the only way she withstood her difficult-to-deflect attacks was by blocking them with ice that shined like a mirror.

Emilia was also often told by Subaru that "Creativity is important!", so she was always particular about the details in her ice-borne weapons, and this time, they were used to their fullest extent.

Thanks to the fact that she always did this, she was able to quickly create weapons that dealt with Sphinx's magic.

Emilia: [Thank you, as always.]

Emilia thanked the absent Subaru, enthusiastically donning gear made of ice.

Subaru, who was probably still working hard somewhere in the Imperial Capital, hand in hand with Beatrice and Spica, was still helping Emilia in this way, even though he was small and not with her.

Just thinking about Subaru allowed Emilia to forget her fatigue and swing her big ice hammer.

Sphinx: [――Removal: Required. And, urgently.]

Facing Emilia, Sphinx kept her distance while she unleashed her magic. While she was exposed to her onslaught, Emilia did not feel the impatience of her opponent, who did not show any expression.

Originally, Sphinx had sneaked into this deserted place to accomplish something. Emilia somehow sensed this and rushed in, which was when the battle began.

That stopped Sphinx from accomplishing whatever she was planning to do.

With this in mind, Emilia, though it not being her forte, was focusing intensely on thoroughly obstructing her opponent.

――Here again, Emilia was making the best of a situation that no one else at the Imperial Capital could.

If Emilia had taken Sphinx's life, the Witch would have taken that memory back to her soul, recognized the threat Emilia posed, and manifested a new body prepared with countermeasures.

However, Emilia had no intention of killing Sphinx, but only of stopping her.

Therefore, the situation Subaru had named Escape by Death did not occur, and Sphinx would not send a new version of herself as reinforcements against the unshared threat of Emilia.

This situation would not have been possible if anyone else had been there, whether it was someone powerful like Cecilus or Halibel, someone wise like Vincent or Roswaal, or even a cheater like Subaru or Al.

No one other than Emilia could have pinned down Sphinx here.

Emilia: [HIYAAA!]

Emilia, who had managed such miraculous meshing by relying on her intuition, nevertheless kicked the light ball away with her ice shoes without being aware of it――,

Emilia: [Even though I don't know what's going on, I won't let you do whatever you're trying to do! And also, tell me where Priscilla is! It's a promise I made with Schult-kun!]

Sphinx: [――. One-sided, and greedy. Truly fitting for a Witch, is it not?]

Sphinx coldly muttered so at Emilia's request.


However, the mutterings were filled with a certain irritation that could not be concealed.

△▼△▼△▼△

――White light enveloped his vision, and in the subsequent instant the world met its end.

That was something Natsuki Subaru had ended up experiencing many times over in a short period, the new stage of Return by Death.

Subaru: [――――]

Held in under the aviating Roswaal’s arm, he was tightly holding on to the hand of Beatrice, who was being held under the other arm, behind Rowaal’s waist.

The presence of Beatrice, the warmth of Roswaal, the sensation of his whole body basking in the wind; all of it was real.

And not only that――,

???: [Regarding the dragon subjugation just now, I think vying for an achievement through the number of heads isn’t really all too pretty. As a matter of fact, isn’t it thunderous applause that’s wanted rather than a feat of heads? So then first things first, how about we show them a combination of two great men from Vollachia and Kararagi!?]

???: [That’d be quite splendid, least for me. I may not’ve been hopin’ ta stand out too much, but it wouldn’t hurt ta elevate my status for this ‘n that after the war.]

With a backwards glance towards the undead Blight Dragon fading into the sky, its existence having been severed, Cecilus and Halibel, after having killed it in a literal flash, could be both seen and heard descending to the ground while pressingly exchanging words.

As the unmistakable apexes of the world, the two were equally transcendent beings, however, the fact that they could not defy the laws of physics and remain in the sky provided a certain sort of satisfaction――,

Subaru: [――Right now…]

Just what exactly was happening, he had no choice but to grasp the new threat, and counter it.

After defending against the Magic Crystal Cannon, after slaying the approaching Blight Dragon, after witnessing the swell of green light blow the clouds away beyond the sky, the Witch still had tricks up her sleeve.

Subaru and the others did not have much time before that would be put into operation, staining the world white and causing them to lose their lives.

Think, think, think. Think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think――.

Beatrice: [――Subaru.]

Indeed, upon Subaru’s eardrums as thoughts raced across his mind, Beatrice called out with a voice of strong conviction.

Holding her hand, the intense feelings of loss surging through Subaru’s body and mind―― no, through his soul, and the determination that he absolutely needed to do something, must have been transmitted to her.

The fact that Beatrice did not exhaust many words on top of that, was proof of her cute self’s high-minded resolve.

Beatrice: [Say whatever you like, I suppose. Betty will aid you in everything, in fact.]

Without having told her much of anything at all, just how much of a relief it was for Beatrice to say that to him.

While feeling disdain build up towards himself for never repaying favors, Subaru nodded. 

And as he nodded――,

Subaru: [――Please bear it until my consciousness is on the verge of bursting apart. I’ll give a signal, so prepare the thing from earlier so it’s ready to go at any time!]

△▼△▼△▼△

――High up in the sky, Subaru shouted loudly, and in response, black and blue colors rushed across the sky.

He did not hear the specifics of the instructions. But instead, he felt he heard them.

Indeed, the sound of the gears of different worlds meshed and began to turn, to spin the light of time.

???: [――――]

It did not matter if it was an auditory hallucination. In fact, it should have been.

Natsuki Subaru thought about it and took the best move to overcome the situation. In this case, he could trust him. ――No, he had to trust him.

That was the best Al―― Aldebaran could do, when he had called out to Subaru that the Witch's plans had not yet been exhausted.

Al: [Shit.]

A short expletive, which echoed in his helmet only to his ears.

Because of that, he felt as if he had noticed he had muttered it unintentionally, like it had been highlighted.

After all, what could Aldebaran have possibly regretted?

He knew from the moment he found Natsuki Subaru in the Empire. When the time came, he knew he should use Natsuki Subaru without hesitation.

In the end, hating it and being unwilling to do so was simply foolish stubbornness.

――I’m merely a following star who can't do the same things as that Natsuki Subaru.

???: […Reconsideration: Required.]

Aldebaran turned wordlessly at the sound of the unexpected voice.

There lay Sphinx, cloaked from the neck down in a solid black light, defenseless on the rough ground.

Sphinx's Gate was completely sealed, and was literally helpless, but she stared at Aldebaran with neither impatience nor anger on her abhorrent face.

It was a disgusting look, as if he was being observed.

Al: [Reconsideration, as in changing your mind? Just what exactly?? You're not gonna tell me what you're thinking, no matter what I do.]

The edges of her mouth contorted, and Aldebaran glared at Sphinx through his helmet.
 
This was also true. ――Aldebaran had already repeatedly interrogated the captured Sphinx to ensure that she would not talk about her plot.

Ironically, among the innumerable number of attempts Aldebaran had, there was a certain number of results that were never distorted.

Even if an infinite number of dice were rolled, he could not get a zero or seven.

Yes, it was impossible to get. ――For Aldebaran.

Al: [But you're done. You've made enemies with someone you shouldn't have made an enemy of. And now you've got to reconsider things――]

Witch: [I have reconsidered my assessment of you.]

Al: [Huh?]

Witch: [I had only recognized you as a mere follower of Priscilla Barielle, but… you are the same as me.]

Al: [――――]

Witch: [You are a martyr who has failed to fulfill the purpose of his own creation, and therefore struggles to live. ――I have achieved the purpose of my own creation, so I cannot help but pity one who still stumbles along.]

Even in captivity, in a position where the magician’s magic was sealed, Sphinx still quietly pitied Aldebaran, not out of vanity or defeat.

Aldebaran's throat froze at Sphinx's honest gaze.

Aldebaran knew that the coldness that froze his throat was the true nature of his murderous intent.

He had to kill this overly talkative, Witch-faced woman. Her life must come to an end. She would not be allowed to say that to Aldebaran with that face.

――Who in the world believes that they have made themselves into Aldebaran?

Al: [You――]

???: [Al! I need your strength!!]

At that moment his vision turned bright red, and his thoughts were blanketed in white.

A few tenths of a second later, Aldebaran would have killed Sphinx. But it was stopped by a furious, gliding wind with the sound of a hard-hitting voice.

???: [I need your help! As you said, the Great Disaster isn’t over yet! It's an all-out war!]

He landed right next to him, and then with a changed look on his face, he called out to Aldebaran.

With two reliable people beside him, a long-haired magician and a dress-wearing Spirit, Natsuki Subaru, who could search for any number of hands to reach the light that Aldebaran could not reach no matter how much he stretched.

Al: [Even if you ask me to lend a hand…]

Subaru: [Shut up!]

Al: [――Hk.]

Aldebaran was mumbling with a mixture of all kinds of embarrassment.

Subaru, however, was oblivious to Aldebaran's inner thoughts and thrusting out his fist,

Subaru: [I don't have time to listen to each person’s concerns right now! So, right now, let’s switch gears and cooperate! You said it before!]

Al: [Me, before…?]

Subaru: [You said you have expectations of me! I'll say the same thing back to you!]

Al: [――Ah.]

Aldebaran gasped as Subaru yelled at him with a red face.

At the same time, he was reminded of his own interaction with Subaru here in the Vollachian Empire and the Fortress City of Guaral, when he was on the verge of losing his own meaning of existence.

Aldebaran encouraged Subaru, whose footing was shaky after being rejected by a girl named Rem.

What had Aldebaran said to him at that time――?

Subaru: [The only way to get all the confidence and everything else you’ve lost back is through results. It's all the same as before!]

Al: [――――]

At the sound of Subaru's voice, the girl who held hands with him, and the long-haired girl who stood behind him, had eyes filled with anticipation.

And so, Subaru, who gave strength to those around him, reached out to Aldebaran in the same way, offered him a hand, and spoke as if in return for that time.

Subaru: [Come on, Al! ――Carry them with me, these heroic reveries!]

And so he spoke.

△▼△▼△▼△

――The Witch's plans, the downfall of the Vollachian Empire, and Death had been fulfilled time and time again.

Perhaps a painless death was the ideal way to end things.

The end that would come before one even knew what had happened might have been the only gentle way to save people from their fear of the end that would eventually come.

However, having thought about that.

Subaru: [No, my ideal ending would be to die peacefully, with Emilia, Beako, and my grandchildren by my side, so that’s not it.]

Even if the Great Disaster were a last-boss situation that brought about a painless and fearless end in order to save all human beings from sorrow and suffering, Subaru would categorically refuse to accept it.

When the ideal ending that he envisioned would arrive, the thought of Emilia and Beatrice, whom he would be leaving behind, brought pain to his heart like being stabbed with glass. Still, it was a problem that Subaru would suffer through and find a solution to before he reached that situation.

By no means could he abandon himself to a sweet dream that someone had given to him.

The whole thing was hypothetical to begin with, and the premise was not valid since the goal of the Great Disaster was not a gentle end, but rather the destruction of the Empire through a series of the most terrible measures imaginable.

That was why, there was no compromise in this battle other than to defeat the objectives of the Great Disaster.

Subaru: […Little by little, I'm starting to see it.]

At first, the world was turned white, and Subaru had no choice but to be swallowed up by the death that was thrust upon him, without knowing what had destroyed him or his companions.

Moreover, Subaru returned just after Roswaal held him and Beatrice on both sides, and Cecilus and Halibel had cut down the attacking Blight Dragon.

After that, in less than a minute, the end would come.

Subaru: [――――]

The time frame was short, and there was much that needed to be done.

If Al had not told him that the Witch was up to something, it would have taken him much longer to uncover it. It probably saved him five or more Return by Deaths.

Still, it took several attempts to determine what was happening.

And, through that trial and error――,

???: [Most likely, the Stone… Muspel will be killed, I suppose. If our opponent has a comeback left to make, then that would be the most likely scenario, in fact.]

???: [The collapse of the Empire’s land, it’s possible that our opponent is preparing a trigger to bring about that Great Disaaaster~. ――If it is Sphinx's usual method, there could also be some kind of magic circle.]

???: [For now, Groovy's lifted the Curse of Thorns, which was our biggest obstacle, so it's not too much ta think that there's more hidden curses than that, right?]

???: [Yeah, yeah! According to Al-san if Anya dies the whole Empire will be destroyed so this may have something to do with that! That means that there’s a possibility that a large army'll be sent to kill Anya! It's been a while since I've slayed a thousand!]

???: [Uu! Uau! Aa, U!]

???: [Are you safe and sound, child…!? I heard that Tanza took very good care of you. If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know.]

???: [Schwartz-sama, I have a bad feeling… is everyone in the Battalion safe?]

???: [Although young, thou hast pleasant eyes. And Mine Star seems to have thy favor, albeit not as much as I favor her. If thou requireth anything, thou may speak.]

???: [Captain! My amazin’ self's glad you're here, but it's too soon to gimme praise! It ain't over yet, right? Anythin’ ya say, I'll do it!]

???: […Get lost. Don't lump me in with you guys, brat.]

???: [Friggin’ disappear… this dragon, has nothing, nothing left…]

???: [Friggin’ disappear… this dragon, has nothing, nothing left…]

???: [Subaru-chin, I'm not good at thinking, but I'll try! Do your best too, Subaru-chin!]

???: [Oh, sorry, but I've lost both my hands, so you're gonna hafta get yerself back on yer own, okay? It looks like there’s no way I can return yer soul ta its original shape kakakakka!]

He was not some superman who could solve everything by figuring it out on his own.

With only one minute to act, Subaru repeatedly exchanged his death over and over again, one move at a time, to steadily improve the board that had been created by the enemy.

The death of the Stone, Muspel, a magic circle, the Curse of Thorns, Arakiya's life, Spica's Star Eating, Yorna's safety, the situation of the Fortified City, the undead Emperor who energetically boasted of his love, Garfiel at his best, the alcoholic not worth talking about, the Dragon who was not interested in talking, the Dragonkin who was not interested in talking, doing his best, not saying things that would make him lose his strength, etc., etc.――. 

Subaru: [――Idiot. Don't look down, Natsuki Subaru.]

Vincent: [You and I have no time to look down. You have decided to struggle.]

Subaru: [I'm not going to give up. ――Who do you take me for?]

How much self-respect was there behind those prideful words?

He would not be so tactless as to peek behind the curtain like that. All right. That was fine.

Giving up, was not an option for Natsuki Subaru.

Subaru: [――――]

The same went for her; no matter how hard he looked, he could not find her.

Rather than being worried about it, his faith now outweighed his fear. ――She might have been in danger, but surely she was doing her best to secure the future, as it would not suit her to stay quiet in a safe place.

That was why, it was time to overturn it. ――The Witch's board.

Subaru: [Come on, Al! ――Carry them with me, these heroic reveries!]

△▼△▼△▼△

An unthinkable absurdity was attempting to overturn the final stratagem of the Witch, Sphinx. 

Sphinx: [――The preparations ought to have been…]

Flawless. Without exception, all were being overturned.

Having achieved the outcome she had desired, the supreme challenge of fulfilling her purpose of creation, the certain sense of accomplishment that had dominated her heart was for but a moment, and the situation was being distorted bit by bit.

Just what stood in the way of Sphinx, in the way of the Great Disaster?

???: [――Vincent Vollachia.]

Sphinx: [――――]

???: [――Aldebaran.]

Sphinx: [――――]

???: [――Natsuki Subaru.]

As if to close the distance towards Sphinx’s mind, crimson lips spoke those names.

Chosen as the Great Disaster, Sphinx had commenced a battle on which the survival of the Empire was staked, and hot on her heels, overturning her plans entirely, was a deterring force attempting to rectify the alignment of the stars.

Sphinx: [From your perspective, how would you evaluate them?]

At Sphinx’s question, the woman looked towards her with a metallic clank of her chains.

The crimson eyes fixed upon Sphinx beyond the water mirror, Priscilla Barielle smiled at the question. Neither ridicule nor pity, it was a smile.

If anybody who knew Priscilla were to have seen that, they would have likely been surprised. For within her smile, affection could be found.

The affection harbored by Priscilla Barielle, towards Sphinx.

Sphinx: [For what reason…]

Priscilla: [Do I make such an expression, you ask? Did you not just enquire regarding mine evaluations of those men? Just as one would expect from the Witch of Greed, your avarice extends to even answers.]

Sphinx: [If you are going to mock me…]

Priscilla: [You ought to be aware. Such is not the case.]

Bluntly told so, Sphinx was silenced by Priscilla’s gaze.

In her eyes and in her words, there was no longer any hue of mockery towards Sphinx. Then, just what was it that dwelt within those crimson eyes?
That was eating away at Sphinx from inside her chest. It was a sensation unknown to her.

This was different from the times when she was continuously spurred on by a sense of duty, that she must fulfill her purpose of creation.
For Sphinx, it was an unbearable, inescapable impulse.

Priscilla: [Remember this. That is what is known as yearning.]

Sphinx: [Yearn, ing…]

Priscilla: [If you wish to procure something that lies beyond your own domain, you must endeavor for it, even if you must withstand the torment of being scorched by flame. There are some who do not desire that, but such a way of life is foolish.]

Sphinx: [――――]

Priscilla: [When scorched in flames, listen carefully to the pleas of your soul. In life, one must yearn. In love, one must drown. ――It is for mine convenience, that this world is made.]

At that declaration, Sphinx truly experienced a sensation akin to being struck by lightning.

An absolute and unshakeable self, and an unwaning confidence; feeling the inescapable heat of that flame, Sphinx truly felt alive for the first time after having died.

At the same time, she yearned. ――She yearned to emerge victorious against the flame-like woman before herself.

Ergo――,

Sphinx: [Countermeasures: Required―― No, let us see if you can prevent this.]

△▼△▼△▼△

Within the Imperial Capital, enclosed by star-shaped ramparts made up of five bastions, exactly inverse to those five bastions, a magic circle had been laid out in the form of a five-pointed star―― the Sphinxes whose duty it was to activate it, while suspicious of the imperfect activation of the technique, were receiving its effects nevertheless.

The effect of the magic circle, its target was the magic crystals of the defenseless Crystal Palace.

Deconstructing the enormous mass of colorless Mana, the Witch, Sphinx, had plotted to take it into her own Mana-drained soul, thereby gaining immense power.

Now that she had succeeded in reproducing the soul of the Witch of Greed, Sphinx wielded the same power as her creator, who possessed knowledge of all kinds of magic. If only she could just secure the Mana for that purpose.

For that purpose――,

Sphinx: [The completion of the magic circle――]

???: [Unfortunately His Excellency and <u>Boss</u> have ordered me to come and prevent that.]

That instant, the surging glint of a sword forbade her from even responding, and lopped Sphinx’s head clean off.

Her white hair trimmed into a bob cut, Sphinx saw the figure of the young man who had killed her within her field of vision as it spun through the air. 

It was an exceedingly beautiful brandish; however, it was still lacking. This was not the end.

Even if it was an incomplete magic circle, it had given her soul some respite. 

What remained――,

Young Man: [――Ahh I see now. You’re also drowning, aren’t you?]

As a result of the choice Sphinx had made directly after, Cecilus Segmunt smiled as he gripped his katana.

Within Cecilus’s vision, as to not allow him to prevent the complete activation of the magic circle, reconstructed from the soul that had received the taste of his slash, several Sphinxes stood in his way.

Tilting her head, one of the Sphinxes obstructing him said,

Sphinx: [There is no water source here. What do you mean by drowning? Explanation: Required.]

Cecilus: [There isn’t any need for a real river or pond or lake or even a puddle. The thing known as the “<u>ocyan</u>” exists in the hearts of all. Those who deeply desire something, every one of us, everyone's drowning.]

At his way of putting it, Sphinx had still not straightened her head.

But, without letting that bother him, Cecilus placed his hand on the hilt of his sheathed katana to ready himself, and gave his introduction.

Cecilus: [――Swordsman, Cecilus Segmunt.]

Sphinx: [――Witch of Greed, Sphinx.]

Before she could even realize, that had naturally spilled out of the Sphinxes’ mouths.

△▼△▼△▼△

At the same time that the Blue Lightning's technique and the Witch's magic shook the Imperial Capital, the same fierce battle to prevent the magic circle from being activated began at the other three locations.

???: [――The Admirer, Halibel.]
???: [――The Witch of Greed, Sphinx.]

???: [――Sixty-first Emperor of Vollachia, Eugard Vollachia.]
???: [――The Witch of Greed, Sphinx.]


???: [――The Gorgeous Tiger, Garfiel Tinzel.]
???: [――The Witch of Greed, Sphinx.]

The elite forces, selected by Natsuki Subaru, faced the Witch as a spear to destroy the final plan of the Great Disaster, and were subjected to a fierce magical onslaught.

Once the magic crystals of the Crystal Palace, which were being dismantled, completely flowed into the Witch's soul, it would no longer be possible to thwart her plans.

Because, her means would be unlimited.

Magic could extend one's possibilities infinitely, depending on the user's imagination and ability to apply it.

In other words, by acquiring an extreme amount of Mana, the Witch, Sphinx, would gain the power of a transcendent being that could make almost anything possible.

It would give her the key to overcome all obstacles, and to fulfill her desires.

However, the truly terrifying thing about Sphinx, was not the vision of her attaining such mighty power.
 
What was truly frightening, was the meticulousness with which she was not focused on one single objective.

Subaru: [Beako! Roswaal!]

Beatrice: [Minya!]

Roswaal: [Ul Goa.]

A storm of purple arrows and flaming projectiles spread out around them with no escape, blowing away the undead who pushed in.

However, even after the advance troops were repelled, the undead stampeding in, their ego was destroyed completely here, and they attacked as puppets following orders. ――To kill Arakiya.

Not just the magic circles, but also stopping them was necessary for Subaru and his team's victory conditions.

Subaru: [Al!]

Al: [Gotcha!]

Breaking through the encirclement, Al pounced on the undead aiming for the girl's life, thrusting the earthen dao, causing it to expand inside his opponent, and explode from within.

He had not seen Al fight since Chaosflame, but even looking at him again, he was too risky and harrowing. He was not a skilled fighter by any stretch of the imagination.

Still, it was an all-out effort, with everyone taking on the challenge together, as best as they could.

Subaru: [――One minute has passed.]

Having overcome the deadly line so far, Subaru realized that the situation had progressed.

Sphinx, the mastermind behind the Great Disaster―― and, to be honest, it was quite a shock for Subaru to see her look so much like Echidna, but it was Beatrice who kept his confusion at bay.

Beatrice remained calm and composed, even when she saw the Witch, who had become an exact duplicate of her creator, Echidna.

Beatrice: [Subaru, that's not the same person as Mother, in fact.]

Roswaal: [Yes, that's right. She is not at all like Echidna, the Witch of Greed. ――She is a most unpleasant opponent, thooough~.]

For some reason, Roswaal's words, which were just as convincing as Beatrice's, pushed Subaru's attention away from the uncanny appearance of the Witch, and focused his attention on discovering her intentions.

First of all, the fact that the Witch, who was supposed to have been burned by Abel's Yang Sword, had changed her form and survived was in itself the ultimate counter to the Yang Sword and Star Eating. 

That strategy must also be taken into consideration.

However, right now――,

Subaru: [If we can completely interrupt the activation of the magic circles――]

It was the moment when he had thought that.

A massive water mirror unfolded in the sky of the Imperial Capital, and images were being projected onto the screen―― the Fortified City of Garkla, faced with a moment of desperation, was about to be obliterated by a falling star.

△▼△▼△▼△

Medium: [――Abel-chin!!]

Medium, who had changed her expression, called out to Vincent with an urgent voice. She held Madelyn in one hand and indicated to the sky with a barbarian sword in the other.

There was a huge distortion of light that seemed to cover the sky of the Imperial Capital, and Vincent immediately understood that it was a thinly-spread mass of water. For a moment, he was wary that it was the next attack prepared by the Witch, but he became convinced when the water's rippling surface reflected a scene from somewhere else immediately afterward.

After all, it was the Witch's attack.

However, it was not a straightforward attack that caused significant injury to the human body, but rather an attack that penetrated the spirit capable of confronting an inescapable reality, in a way that no one could take their eyes off of it.

――Reflected in the water mirror in the sky, was the Fortified City, surrounded by a massive army of undead.

One could see the starlight rain down from above the Fortress of the Sword Wolves, which had drawn the army of the undead and, like Vincent and the others, was fighting for the very survival of the Empire.

This, was a beautiful judgment of destruction that would also bring ruin upon the Imperial Capital.

If they were to fall upon the Fortified City, the walls and fortress would fall, and most of those encamped within would die. That would mean the downfall of the Empire, which would not be able to be rebuilt even if the operation in the Imperial Capital succeeded.

Starlight over the Imperial Capital, the fires of destruction, the outburst of the Magic Core, and the magic circle targeting the Crystal Palace.

The Witch's successive plots were to destroy not only the Imperial Capital, but also the Empire.

The wise man was the one who would strike the true fatal blow, never letting it be realized.

That was why――,

Vincent: [――Our despair has been borne out, Natsuki Subaru.]

Yes, right after Vincent spoke.

――The fire of destruction pierced straight through a hole in the clouds, as if to smash through the water mirror in the sky, towards the north of the Imperial Capital.

△▼△▼△▼△

――Truly, it was the trump card of Natsuki Subaru and Beatrice.

The fire of destruction from the Magic Crystal Cannon, sent into another space by Al Shamak, was returned to this space by a subsequent Al Shamak, shooting down the starlight that was supposed to destroy the Fortified City.

With the assistance of Cecilus and Halibel, that trump card did not have to be used to slay the Blight Dragon, and instead, it was used to defeat the last move prepared by the Witch to unsettle them.

Subaru: [――Hk.]

Subaru felt dizzy from the intense feeling of exhaustion, and his nose began to bleed as he was bathed in a multitude of water drops from the shattered water mirror, which rained upon the Imperial Capital like a passing storm.

It was the backlash from Beatrice's endless display of seriousness over the past few hours.

Beatrice's adorableness might have been priceless, but there was a heavy cost to pay for her abilities. There was a limit as to how much of that burden could be shared with the Pleiades Battalion.

Subaru involuntarily dropped to one knee as his limits flashed before his eyes.

Beatrice: [Subaru!]

He was supported by the shouting Beatrice; however, he could not speak, even though he wanted to reassure her.

Beatrice tried to stop the unending, dripping nosebleed with the sleeve of her dress. He did not want her beautiful outfit to become stained, but he could not lift his arms.

Subaru: [Not yet, not yet…]

He could not afford to stop here.

There was still a role he had to play, a plot that still needed to be thwarted.

This was an all-out war, and it was none other than Subaru who had made that decision.

For Subaru to be the first to run out of steam, there was no way such a ridiculous story could exist.

Consequently――,

Subaru: [――Huh?]

Beatrice: [Subaru? You shouldn't force yourself, in fact. Take a moment to rest――]

Beatrice hurriedly tried to admonish Subaru, who had suddenly let out a breath. But, Beatrice's words stopped mid-sentence. ――Because, Subaru stood up suddenly, on the spot.

Beatrice: [――――]

Beatrice's round eyes widened, and she looked at Subaru as he stood up. As she met his gaze, Subaru looked down at his hands, bewildered.

The sense of emptiness that had gripped Subaru's entire body until just before had disappeared without a trace. ――No, it was not that the feeling of emptiness had vanished. Rather, it was the opposite.

Subaru: [My strength… is increasing?]

Subaru was dumbfounded, and just as he said this, his whole body was filled with energy.

It was a similar feeling to that of being united with the other members of the Pleiades Battalion, having even the strength of one's body and mind intensely heightened. ――A feeling of omnipotence, of being enveloped by a great flame.

Subaru immediately understood what had caused this to happen.

――The shattered water mirror in the sky, and the fire of destruction that pierced the light of the distant star, drawing a band of light. Sweeping both of them away, in the sky of the Imperial Capital, was birthed a new light.

It paled in comparison to the light of the star, and even paled in comparison to the fire of destruction, but in terms of its brilliance, it was not only equal to them, it overwhelmed them.

Falling from the sky, adorned in a dress the color of blood, was a woman like a flame――.

???: [――Well done.]

Everyone looked up to the sky, even as the water mirror tried to reflect despair. However, it was more than that; it attracted the eyes of everyone in the Imperial Capital to the sky, and set their souls ablaze.

She descended. A female Sword Wolf, with fluttering orange hair, and blazing crimson eyes――.

???: [No superfluous words are needed. ――You may call upon mine name.]
