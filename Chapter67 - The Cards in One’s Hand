*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――Taking in the Stone, Muspel, Arakiya had ended up placing her life or death upon the same scales as the survival of the Vollachian Empire.

As Priscilla had said, the combination of the Soul Marriage Technique and the Dream Sword Masayume had brought about a situation quite capable of greatly derailing Sphinx’s plan.

Sphinx’s two objectives in becoming the bearer of the Great Disaster, and flooding the Vollachian Empire with the dead―― one of them, that of reproducing the soul of the Witch of Greed, had succeeded. The rest was only a matter of time until this soul became acclimated to the vessel, and the existence of Sphinx herself was painted over by her creator.

Thus, before that was fulfilled and Sphinx fully disappeared, her remaining objective―― let it be deliberately asserted as revenge. She would enact her revenge upon Priscilla Barielle.

For that purpose, she intended to make the best use of the cards remaining in her hand.

However――,

Sphinx: [――The Magic Crystal Cannon has been stopped, hm?]

Witnessing the series of continuously occurring miscalculations, Sphinx silently muttered to herself.

Reflected in the surface of the floating water mirrors, were those who were taking action in various places throughout the Imperial Capital of Lupugana, individuals capable of holding back the ruination of the Vollachian Empire.

What drew the attention of Sphinx, who had transformed into a form identical to that of the Witch of Greed, above all else, were the boy and the Spirit who had prevented the attack from the Magical Crystal Cannon, the trump card of the Crystal Palace.

That Spirit, taking the form of a girl, had also successfully countered the Magical Crystal Cannon with the same method before Sphinx had commanded the dead in the form of the Great Disaster, and began conducting a full-scale offensive against the Empire. But, by Sphinx’s judgment, that was supposed to be a sacrificial technique that threatened the disappearance of the Spirit herself.

To carry out that same thing in merely two, three days, and survive unscathed, did not make rational sense. 

The factor that had defied reason, was the boy who was likely contracted with the Spirit in his embrace.

Sphinx: [So it is you again?]

The inexplicable boy who, while allying himself with the Vollachian Emperor, had thwarted the stratagems of the incomplete Witch, Sphinx, before she had replicated the Witch of Greed.

In truth, if she had been unable to grasp the final fragment to recreate her soul in the eleventh hour, Sphinx’s days of hard efforts exceeding three-hundred years would have been put to an end by them.

And, that threat yet persisted even now, with her having attained the Witch of Greed.

Sphinx: [――The Yang Sword Vollachia, and the Authority of Gluttony.]

Even if she had succeeded in her long-cherished desire to recreate the Witch of Greed, for Sphinx, who was as of yet, still dead, the fact that those two were her fatal weak points remained unchanged.

Therefore, while producing several beings sharing the same soul as herself, Sphinx would take care to not draw near to the owner of the Yang Sword, or that Spirtual Arts User boy.

On top of that――,

Sphinx: [With all of the cards in my hand, I shall emerge victorious.]

Priscilla: [――――]

At Sphinx’s mutter, Priscilla’s expression across the water mirror changed.

A slight smile had emerged on her face. ――In that smile, there was no displeasure or discomfort; in order to distort it with at least a fragment of sorrow, Sphinx would throw everything she had at it.

△▼△▼△▼△

A void had appeared in the distant sky, and swallowed the flame that would have spelled the destruction of the Vollachian Empire.

Cutting into the trajectory of the fired Magic Crystal Cannon, Natuski Subaru had achieved his goal. It appeared that The Admirer Halibel, Spica and Beatrice had each also carried out their respective roles.

???: [It is a great service. ――However.]

While acknowledging their achievement, the forefront of Emperor Vincent’s thoughts harbored a sense of unease.

The neutralizing of the Magic Crystal Cannon, the Empire’s decisive weapon, over and over again in this manner, was problematic.

――In any nation, a force of deterrence that would dissuade other countries from invading was a constant requirement.

Whether it be the military that could rival its neighbors, the exceptionally strong whom no one could compare to, or the powerful weapon capable of overturning any predicament――if any of these factors had been missing, the present prosperity of the Empire would not have come to be.

The weight of that undeniable history, was being eroded to naught but a trace by the Great Disaster that stemmed from the insurrection.

Vincent: [In that sense, you all have already destroyed the Imperial Code that had been protected by the law of iron and blood.]

While clenching his teeth to bite back his shame, Vincent brandished the Yang Sword.

Before Vincent’s eyes, leaping over the flame of the treasured sword that had been drawn in a horizontal line, undead of a kind that differed from those until this point could be seen rushing towards him.

Just what was different about them? That was simple. ――Vincent could not recognize them.

Vincent: [That detestable Witch, had she managed to learn of it prior to her demise?]

In the garden before the Crystal Palace which had turned into a battlefield, appearing one after the other before Vincent as he held the frontline, were all undead who had likely carved their names into the history of the Vollachian Empire in ancient times. 

Vincent could match the faces and names of all the Imperial soldiers of his time, however, he was unable to determine the identities of the undead resurrected from the past, with whom he had no direct acquaintance.

Based on his intuition, thus far, among the dead called forth by the Great Disaster, the proportion of those from the recent times had been overwhelmingly high. In the most extreme cases, those that perished while fighting the undead had been instantly resurrected as an undead. ――This would be speculation, but perhaps souls also possessed an aspect of freshness.

Or it could simply be that the further back in time one went, the more difficult it was to resurrect the dead, or a greater cost was required.

Therefore, the majority of the resurrected corpses were from recent times, and thus, Subaru and his companions Star Eating in combination with Vincent's memories was highly effective, but――,

Vincent: [Are these the ones to which it cannot be applied?]

Even if there were other conditions imposed on resurrection, be it large or small, the best way to prevent Star Eating was to prepare undead who do not correspond to Vincent's memories. 

It seemed the Witch had come to understand this before her soul was consumed by the flames.

In other words, there remained no means to defeat the unknown ancient warriors that stood in the way except Vincent’s Yang Sword. ――No, if it were just the Yang Sword, then there was another besides Vincent’s own.

Vincent: [――Priscilla.]

Yes, spinning the name of his younger sister whose whereabouts remained unknown after the evacuation, Vincent resumed his battle with the attacking undead.

His foolish younger sister, formerly named Prisca Benedict, presently went by the name of Priscilla Barielle.

Upon confirming the fact that after leaving the Empire, she had changed her name and become one of the Royal Election candidates for the Kingdom of Lugunica, Vincent had nearly fainted. But it was bearable.

Her reason for rushing to the aid of her homeland was not something endearing like being concerned for Vincent or the Empire. Rather it was to silence the one who owned the blade of the assassin that had been sent for her. 

But then, that recklessly presumptuous soul had already gone ahead and lost his life.

Vincent: [Chisha.]

Chisha, the one who, deceiving even Vincent, had resolved to defy the world’s fate of the Great Disaster, was among the few who knew that Prisca had survived as Priscilla.   

Chisha, who knew of her fierce temperament from her time as Prisca, intending for her to be alongside Vincent who must ward off the Great Disaster, was likely to take drastic measures to bring her over.

Beneath that white expressionless visage, he may even have thought about how the matters of the Imperial Crown needed be handled post-war――, 

Chisha: [The fact that it was necessary to go to such lengths, I am forced to revise my opinion of your Excellency.]

At the echo of Chisha, the embodiment of disrespect and disloyalty to the Emperor, he clicked his tongue. 

Setting aside his annoyance at his own all too surreal visions of him, Vincent kept Chisha’s parting gift――the conclusion regarding how Priscilla should be dealt with, as his own responsibility. 

Presently, Priscilla’s life was safe, as confirmed by Sphinx’s attempt to bring Vincent to her. That much was good enough for now.

As for what was lacking in his Yang Sword, it would be fulfilled when Vincent becomes more accustomed to being the apex of the land of the Sword Wolf. ――The moment this thought crossed his mind.

???: [――Thy valiant striving is magnificent. As thy predecessor, I doth swell with pride.]

A deep, sonorous voice struck Vincent's eardrums amidst the clash of swords.

Simultaneously, his field of vision was diagonally bisected by a sword flash so transcendent that Vincent, who had witnessed the swordsmanship of many a warrior, would deem it preeminent. 

That flash, swept across the warriors of old who had dared to wound Vincent’s noble presence; and being unable to evade, their bodies――no, their souls were ignited.

In other words, it had been a strike from the Yang Sword.

Vincent: [――――]

A moment ago, he had concluded that his desire for a reinforcement who wielded the crimson treasured sword would not be met.  

Hence, Vincent’s eyes widened slightly at the arrival of this unlikely aid, and upon stealing a glance at the profile of the person standing back-to-back with him, his breath was caught.

It was a familiar visage. ――That appearance, he had seen in the paintings of old.

Vincent: [――The Emperor of the Briar?]

???: [The crown of the Emperor has been duly bequeathed unto the succeeding generation, and now, it doth rest upon thee. For mineself to lay claim to the title “Emperor of the Briar” would be folly. ――I am Eugard Vollachia.]

Vincent: [――――]

Eugard: [Hmm. Thou appearst both sagacious and well-favored. In retrospect, never have I beheld the faces of mine children and descendants in proximity. However, were it feasible, mineself would have exchanged many words, and fain to gaze upon their faces for long.

While the person continued to speak――the undead who had called himself Eugard Vollachia, Vincent remained silent.

That tranquil aura he exuded, with eyes that held the light of reason and skin that had the color of life, distinguished him from the countless undead encountered thus far. Why was there not the hostility towards the living that characterized the undead, or the signs of being deprived of free will?

Eugard: [Mine love for Mine Star, is why.]

Vincent: [What?]

Eugard: [Didst thou not seek an answer to wherefore mineself acts thus, or was I mistaken?]

For a moment, Vincent attempted to discern the true meaning behind those words, but he quickly gave up.

He had to reconsider. For if Eugard Vollachia was indeed the same personage as described in the old tale of Iris and the King of Thorns, then to doubt his words, although incomprehensible, would be foolish.

Therefore――,

Vincent: [The reigning Vollachian Emperor, Vincent Vollachia.]

Eugard: [Understood. Then, let us march.  ――O Child of mine own Children.]

Thus was Eugard’s response to Vincent’s introduction, and the two Emperors stood side by side.

An impossibility due to the code of iron and blood of the Vollachian Empire, where the rite of succession to the Imperial Throne, the Imperial Selection Ceremony, took place upon death, this was two fellow Sword Wolves mounting a united front.

△▼△▼△▼△

――The fierce battle to decide the fate of the world continued in the Imperial Capital Lupugana.

The battle at each bastion between the predominant people one by one came to a close, both the living and the dead doing their utmost best, some failing while others proceeded forward.

As if to laugh at efforts of everyone, two disasters attempted to reset everything――the starlight that crashed through the sky was cut down by a swordsman who would not let go of his dream, and the fire of destruction created by sacrificing the lives of countless Spirits was stopped by a boy resisting fate and his friends who supported him.

The prevention of both disasters was the result of each person using all of their power that they had.

However, it was not the starlight being severed or the fire of destruction being erased that contributed the most to the war situation for the living.

It was a man who alone arrived to stop the next step of the Great Disaster that no one else could have realized or reached even if they had.

???: [――Good grief, ya making old people work too much.]

The Vicious Old Man Olbart Dunkelkenn leapt with his small frame as he grumply complained.

The low leaping, ground-crawling movements of the Shinobi chieftain, the monstrous old man aimed for the undead sorcerer guarding the red blood magic circle painted at the end of the passage.

The sorcerer turned their palm to Olbart, and then the black filth from the walls and floor around him formed chains that roared out to bind the limbs of the approaching old monster――,

Olbart: [I’ve been doin’ this for ninety years.]

Faster than the chains could reach him, Olbart swung his right arm――the arm missing from the elbow, hard and threw a kunai from within its supposedly empty sleeve.

It pierced with super-speed between the eyebrows of the sorcerer who was wary of his approach, and knocked them into the magic circle on the wall. Immediately after, Olbart struck with his left palm and punched through the sorcerer and the magic circle.

His martial arts that have been polished since he could remember shattered the sorcerer and magic circle to pieces.

He was under strict orders not to kill any more undead than necessary, but this soul-tampered abnormality and opponents like the sorcerer he just saw were exceptions to that order.

The magicians who guarded the magic circle that disturb the space within the castle, he has taken care of about ten of them――,

Olbart: [――. Finally done.]

Olbart muttered, sensing the change in the air on his dry old skin.

He could see the inside of the Crystal Palace glaring at him with his pair of eyes hidden by his abundant eyebrows, and the strange atmosphere that pervaded the place ――the anomaly that had transformed the familiar structure of the castle into a strange magical palace, had been lifted.

The door that should be connected was not connected, and the window through which he got in did not allow him to reach his desired place, it is unknown whether it was an illusionary technique or a magic that twisted the space itself――,

Olbart: [For now, with this my job is… oy, oy that's bad, isn’t it?]

Right after solving one problem and then getting put into another, Olbart hushed his voice.

As soon as the twist in space had been fixed, the next anomaly in the Crystal Palace was easy to understand.――The whole entire castle was being charged with Mana waves; the Magic Crystal Cannon was activated.

Olbart: [Drat, Moguro, hang in there a lil’ bit longer.]

As the Magic Crystal Cannon started to vibrate, Olbart complained about the core of the Crystal Palace, Moguro Hagane, ――the Steelman, also known as the Meteor of the Crystal Palace itself.

Until now, the commendable Moguro had been obeying Vincent's instructions and trying to prevent the Great Disaster from using the Magic Crystal Cannon, but it seems that they have broken through.

It was very bad that the Magic Crystal Cannon was taken in as the opponent's weapon.

Olbart: [If they target Garkla, we'll be in serious trouble.]

The Fortified City, which has attracted a large army of the dead and is supposed to be fighting a siege for the survival of the empire, must have its strong defensive walls preserved for the battle. If the Magic Crystal Cannon were to blow it down, the situation would fall drastically and the city would be destroyed.

And that would be the same as if the Vollachian Empire were to suffer irreversible damage.

Even if Olbart and the others were able to destroy the mastermind behind the Great Disaster, the loss of the current Fortified City personnel would make it impossible to rebuild the empire――which would mean the end of the Vollachian Empire.

――Olbart Dunkelkenn had ambitions.

As a leader of the Shinobi, who were required to work in the shadows of history, he intended to make his mark on the history of the Empire and destroy the very foundation of the way of being a Shinobi, to which he had devoted his life.

For that reason, the allure of flashy outbursts, such as a quick rebellion against the Emperor or his assassination, had often been tempting. The Great Disaster had put an end to that, and the time was not right for a betrayal, but here he was.

If the Magic Crystal Cannon were used in a manner that would determine the outcome of the Great Disaster, then Olbart would fulfill his ambitions not as an Imperial General but rather as a Shinobi.

Whatever was planned for the Great Disaster, he would gallantly rush to Vincent's side, snatch the victory from him, and fulfill his personal ambitions.

Therefore――,

Olbart: [――This is my final betrayal.]

After the spatial twist had resolved, Olbart ran up the castle and arrived at the cannon's battery. There, he watched as the fire of doom was engulfed by a large hole in the sky, his white eyebrows fluttering in the aftermath of the Magic Crystal Cannon, which had been fired by the narrowest of margins.

If the Magic Crystal Cannon had determined the destruction of the Empire, Olbart could have betrayed it without any regrets.

But, that did not happen.

Olbart: [Kakakakka! That little kid not only did it in Demon City, but he did it here too! I swear, the young people these days don't have a shred of respect for the elderly!]

Olbart had a hearty laugh at the sight of the two distant figures in the sky: the black-haired boy and the little Spirit girl.

This is the second time, including Chaosflame, that Olbart's assumptions about the boy were thrown off the table. But there is no anger or hatred for what he did to him.

As one got older, it became easier to give up on many things ――and not just because Olbart was bad at giving up. So he didn't give up. He just admitted defeat.

Olbart: [If they outperform me, then that's that.]

In nearly one hundred years of life, there have been countless dreams that Olbart has not been able to fulfill. Of course, there are many that have come true by force. That was the way of things.

Thus, Olbart was able to let go of his long-held desire to leave his name in history by assassinating the Emperor in a fit of desperation, an imperialistic outburst comparable to that of the wolf man who killed Iris in Iris and the King of Thorns.

Then, he let go of his long-cherished desire and prepared his empty left hand for a hand chop――,

Olbart: [――Then you'll come with me in my next dream of bein’ the next Hero to save the country, won't you?]

???: [――――]

A white-haired woman was standing right next to the battery in front of Olbart, who was smiling lightly.

At the top of the Crystal Palace, in the turret of the Magic Crystal Cannon that had just finished discharging the fire of destruction, a sweltering torrent of Mana blew around, stirring the senses as much as it wanted to.

At the center of it, the keystone of the Crystal Palace with its crystal stones of various sizes, the base on which the magical core, the heart of the Magic Crystal Cannon, was installed, the white woman smiled as she placed her hand on the pedestal.
、
And then――,

???: [It is undesirable for you to be here. ――Elimination: Required.]

???: [Do not Olbart, your opponent, Witch.]

A black wind began to swirl around the smiling woman ――the Witch, and the magic core itself spoke in Moguro's voice, as if to alert him against it.

Olbart smiled at the obvious warning from The Steelman, 

Olbart: [I know that without bein’ told. ――I'm not senile at my age.]

Kicking the floor, The Vicious Old Man ended his dream ――and delayed the demise of the Empire that would have been in that moment.

△▼△▼△▼△

Subaru: [Like I’d ever let you! ――Bring it on, oh inevitable fate!!]

Beatrice's Al Shamak embraced it, and sent away one of the Magic Crystal Cannon's shots.

Subaru felt the power to do so being drawn out of him, but he had an unfounded confidence that he could sustain Beatrice's reckless act.

――No, now that he had succeeded, he could reiterate that it was a well-founded conviction.

Subaru: [Maybe it's the power of the connection!]

Subaru's Cor Leonis, which takes on and distributes burdens, has remained connected to all of the Pleiades Battalion, who are located far away from him.

It not only enhanced the strength of everyone as a unit but also lent a shoulder to anyone who might be falling behind, pushing them along and distributing the vitality to run together.

This power represented the realization of "One for all, all for one".

It was quite probable, perhaps even likely, that a huge burden was suddenly placed on everyone fighting in the Fortified City at this very moment, but he wanted to believe it would be all right.

Either way――,

Beatrice: [It was very important that we prevented that from happening, I suppose.]

Subaru: [Ah! I thought they were going after Garkla…]

Subaru watched the hole in the sky close and responded to Beatrice, who raised her voice.

Subaru and the others, determined to stop the Magic Crystal Cannon, rushed into its line of fire, but they had thought that the cannon was aimed at the Fortified City.

The biggest fear is that the Fortified City, where the battle of the century was currently being fought, will receive an irrevocable shot rather than blowing up a single location in the Imperial Capital.

However, when they actually prevented it, the Magic Crystal Cannon was aimed at the south side of the Imperial Capital.

Subaru: [There is no such thing as a meaningless attack. They definitely had a plan.]

Beatrice: [――. That troublesome one to the south, they went after Garfiel, didn't they, in fact?]

Subaru: [Sure, our Garfiel is like a little brother who is not embarrassed to go anywhere, but…]

At the first bastion, the southernmost point of the Imperial Capital, the Cloud Dragon Mezoreia was stationed to protect the widest area, and Garfiel was entrusted with defeating it alone.

Frankly speaking, it was a big role, not just absurd, but unreasonable and reckless, but it was a role that could not be entrusted to anyone other than Garfiel. Considering its importance, it is not impossible that the other party was targeting Garfiel.

Subaru: [Who fired the shot in the first place? Now that you've taken down Sphinx, who's the next in charge?]

Beatrice: […It's doubtful that it's the reanimated Emperor Vollachia or some such, I suppose.]

Subaru: [Please don't give any more reasons for not wanting to help the Empire at this point…!]

Just when it seemed that Sphinx, the leader of the Great Disaster, had been defeated, he did not want the previous Emperors of Vollachia to rise up to become the last boss, because of the failures of the modern Empire.

First, if that pattern is allowed to continue, it will be impossible to know how many Emperors are needed to be defeated.

Beatrice: [But it seemed like they had a clear aim in the way they were assembling that attack just now, in fact. That's why…]

Subaru: [――Beako!]

Subaru sounded a sharp call as Beatrice stared at the ground, her twin drills flapping in the wind of free fall.

He cupped Beatrice's cheeks between his hands and made her look up in the direction he wanted her to see. As their gazes converge―― they are met by the reflection of a huge, majestic three-headed Dragon flying fiercely through the sky.

The Blight Dragon, which had attacked them in the coupled dragon carriage and had once been defeated by Halibel, had revived and was approaching Subaru and Beatrice, who had counteracted the Magic Crystal Cannon.

Subaru: [Crap, this is bad, we can't move!]

Beatrice: [――! Here comes the breath, I suppose!]

With clear hostility, the three heads of the Blight Dragon turn toward Subaru and Beatrice.

In contrast, the embraced Subaru and Beatrice were in the air, in free fall, and quite a distance away from the dependable Spica and Halibel.

Beatrice: [Murak is released, in fact!]

Subaru: [And Invisible Providence after!]

Subaru and Beatrice worked in perfect coordination ――Beatrice canceled Murak as the Blight Dragon's breath became a black heat ray. The speed of their fall, which had been like that of leaves dancing in the air, gained weight, and they accelerated it further by throwing themselves downwards with Invisible Providence.

With that, Subaru and Beatrice forcibly escaped the line of fire of the Blight Dragon's breath. ――However, they were only able to escape the first one.

There are signs of the remaining two heads releasing the same breath――, 

Subaru: [――Hk.]

In his head, he desperately searched for a card that could be used, made sense, and would work now.

As Subaru's thoughts began to spin at high speed, and his whole body was dominated by the hot sensation of being on fire, he quickly bit his molars and pulled Beatrice tightly to him.
 
And then, he tried to verbalize his thoughts.

???: [――Oh deee~ar, unlike me, you guys can’t fly freely, so I hope you won't be too surpriii~sed.]

Then, Subaru and Beatrice are snatched away at the sound of a voice filled with exasperation and amusement.

The Blight Dragon's breath became two black heat rays that swept across the sky of Imperial Capital, but the Subaru and Beatrice were not in its line of fire. They were held up by long, slender arms.

It was――,

Subaru: [Roswaal! Nice timing! You saved us!]

Beatrice: [This is humiliating, I suppose! Holding Betty like this is unacceptable, in fact!]

Roswaal: [Well, well, that's quite an extreme difference in reactiooo~ns.]

Subaru, Beatrice, and the flying magician Roswaal smirked at the reactions from either side.

He put his arms around the waist of Subaru and Beatrice, holding them at his sides as he soared freely through the air, toying with the "three-headed" Blight Dragon --Valgren, with its wings flapping in the air,

Roswaal: [Good job stopping the Magic Crystal Cannon. What's the situaaa~tion?]

Subaru: [Sphinx has been defeated! Maybe the cause of the zombies is in Crystal Palace! We don't know what the Magic Crystal Cannon was aiming at just now!]

Roswaal: [Sphinx? That's both a blessing and a disappointment, but…]

Beatrice: [――? Is that a concern or a complaint, I suppose?]

Beatrice was unsparing when it came to Roswaal's words and actions, but Roswaal's expression turned slightly grim as he narrowed his differently colored eyes.

Subaru was wary of the expression on Roswaal's unmade-up face, which had a more-than-usual intensity and was alarmed by the reason for his grim expression.

As it was, Roswaal continued as if he were speaking himself rather than Subaru and Beatrice.

Roswaal: [Beginning with the interruption of the decisive battle of the Imperial Capital, our opponents have carefully hindered us. As well as the shot from the Magic Crystal Cannon… Is that really everything?]

He said.

△▼△▼△▼△

――Vincent and Eugard, two Emperors of Vollachia who normally would not be able to entrust their backs to each other, were performing a sword dance, and the red sword flashes with flames were raging like a storm.

Tanza: [Amazing…]

Tanza muttered in amazement at the sight, which was like an illusion that burnt her eyes.

Eugard, having sensed the signs of battle from the direction of the Crystal Palace, went ahead, and by the time Tanza, holding hands with Yorna, caught up with him, the two emperors were already fighting together.

The undead whose souls were being set ablaze by the brilliance of the Yang Sword were all very skilled, and there was not much difference between them and the undead Rowan.

But the howling winds of the red swords kept them at bay, and they were overwhelmed by the coordinated efforts of Eugard and Vincent, who exchanged neither words nor glances.

Yorna: […This is the first time I've ever seen His Excellency, wielding a sword with someone like that.]

Suddenly, Yorna, who was staring at the same scene as Tanza, remarked.

Tanza could not comprehend the complexity of the emotions contained therein. ――The shaking eyes and trembling voice, all of which were created by years of not being able to do more than lean on Tanza.

Obviously, she did not know the details of the situation.

However, Yorna was in love with Eugard, who came back from a long time ago, and she knew that there was more to it than simple longevity.

Tanza's unfamiliarity with these bonds made it seem like she and Eugard were more or less superior to each other.

Yorna: [I love both you, Tanza, and His Excellency. Both of you are very dear to me, and I love you both in my heart, just in different ways.]

Tanza: [Ah…]

Anxiety slipped into Tanza's chest, and Yorna found it, making her want to hide her face.

But Tanza relied on the feeling of the hand in her hand, and with the reason why she was standing here in her heart, she stopped feeling sorry for herself or miserable any longer.

She had to keep her face up.
 
That is what Tanza had in common with all the amazing people she had ever met.

Tanza: [――Hk.]

Gritting her teeth, Tanza's nerves were on edge.

She was entrusted with protecting Yorna, who was not in good shape and perhaps emotionally traumatized from the battle with the dreadful Rowan. She could not rely on Eugard, who was fighting, or even on Emilia, who had separated from her on her way here.

So, as long as Tanza was not able to join Eugard and Vincent in their battle, all she could do was to be the first to notice anything unusual in their surroundings――.

Tanza: [――Yorna-sama! Look!]

Her vigilance paid off.

Tanza's round eyes widened, and she pointed to the Crystal Palace's top level with the hand not clasped to Yorna's. Yorna looked up at the same thing Tanza was looking at. Looking up at the same thing as Tanza, Yorna stared up with her almond-shaped eyes.

Their gazes fell on the half-spherical tower near the top of the Crystal Palace ――Tanza did not know, but it was the tower where the Magic Crystal Cannon, the trump card of the Crystal Palace, was located.

The tower glowed from within, and then, in a violent explosion, the walls were blown away. Tanza blinked as the tower was destroyed, scattering pieces of the castle in a spectacular manner.

Then, a small shadow appeared out of the thick plume of smoke――,

Yorna: [Old Man Olbart?]

Yorna's voice, somewhat taken aback, was evidence of her surprise at what she saw.

Slowly, Olbart emerged from the broken wall, not looking his usual aloof self, but with blood staining his tattered garb.

Just then, Olbart noticed Tanza and the other living people below him――,

Olbart: [Your Excellency! We're in serious trouble if we don't do something! The Witch is not finished with her tricks yet!]

Yes, he shouted in a desperate voice, as if to encourage an impression that was out of character.

△▼△▼△▼△

And so, at the same time that Olbart shouted in his blood-stained garb ――Emilia stood there, feeling deeply sorry that she had taken an unplanned action because of her intuition.

It was a big decision to go against the wishes of Subaru and Abel, both of whom had worked very hard to think through the best course of action and to act alone from Tanza, Yorna, and the others.

Emilia: [If only my misunderstanding bothered me, I thought I had to hurry back to Tanza-chan and the others…]

Following a slight unease and a change in the air, a misapprehension that seemed to wash over her, Emilia ran not to the Crystal Palace, but further north.

And there she found someone she was not supposed to have met.

If someone was merely there, no one would immediately assume they were doing something wrong, no matter who they were dealing with. But this other person was a bit of an exception.

Because――,

Emilia: [This is reaaally surprising. ――Why is Echidna here?]

At Emilia's prompt, the white-haired Witch turned to look.

She spoke with only the slightest hint of surprise at her well-formed appearance.

Witch: [I think that me being surprised would be more appropriate. ――Witch of Envy.]

She declared.
