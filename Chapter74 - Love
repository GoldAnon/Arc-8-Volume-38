*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――What was necessary is to take hold of that which was formless.

The thing certainly existed, but, when it was touched, it lost its original shape and moved away as if it slipped through outstretched fingers.

Like water, like wind, like light.
Like heat, like a shadow, like a dream.

The more one dared to touch it, the more one feared breaking it, and the further away it grew.

???: [Even if you try to touch me, you will not be able to catch me.]

They could not touch the person who was right in front of them, even though they were definitely touching them.

They were certain that they could feel their feet pressed into the ground, their skin bathed in the setting sun that turned the world crimson, and their eyes determined to look at the person in front of them, even though they could feel the heat of the flame that was in their eye.

???: [――Sphinx".]

They called out the name of the one who took the role of the Witch, who plotted it all and wished to be a disaster, and ate it.

This despicable Authority, which has taken the lives of many human beings, created misery, and shrouded disaster, now was to be used to seize happiness, to restore the lives of many fairly.

Witch's soul refused to do so, and they diligently pursued their soul as it literally underwent a thousand transformations.

???: [――――]

By continually raising the undead, the Witch Sphinx learned the nature of the soul.

As a result, she succeeded in the rebirth of the "Witch of Greed," and by changing the state of her soul, she was able to escape the flame of the "Yang Sword" and the light of the "Star Eating" by changing the nature of her soul.

It seemed to be a tremendous and aimless journey, like searching for a needle dropped in a great desert, or for a Spirit that does not know words that has melted away into the air, or for a partner who has plunged into an ocean that does not exist in this world.

???: [Never sail out to the <u>open sea</u> without a map and compass.]

As Subaru attempted to challenge the last great battle of the Empire's upheaval, a man from his same world called to him.

His bare face, was covered by a cold iron helmet, that he never showed. Perhaps his ――Al's eyes, like Subaru's, were burning, lit with the same flame.

Subaru realized that he was in a position where he was not very reliable.

Al was right. If you know that you are standing in a desert, looking out at an unknown world, floating on a great ocean, then you should not be reckless.

???: [――Uau.]

The small hand that held his right hand asserted their presence with heat and touch.

It was not just because they were holding each other's hands that they knew that Spica was there. It was because before they even touched, they had clashed many times in an attempt to understand her.

Again and again, Natsuki Subaru tried to understand this incomprehensible girl――.

Subaru: [The map is my heart. My compass is you. ――Spica, Rem.]

The more he thought back, his first days when he was sent to the Vollachian Empire were the worst.

Unable to rely on anyone, he was pushed away by Rem, who he wanted to stay close to, and was kept close to Spica, who he tried to keep away, and kept on walking, unable to find his way.

But even without her memories, Rem was still Rem, and even with her past, Spica was still Spica. No matter where he went, what he did, or who he met, Subaru was always Subaru.

Subaru: [――Sphinx.]

He called her name and held hands with Spica, trying to touch the Witch's soul.

――The power of Star Eating was a wish.

It was a convenient and selfish wish to save someone with a power that had only served to deprive and undermine them, just like entrusting one's wish to a shooting star.

But that was why one must be sincere because one is making a wish on something that is not inherently so.

It was not just a matter of calling someone by name. Knowing their name and calling them is the same as declaring that you will join them on stage, that you will participate in their life.

Subaru: [If that's the case, you have to look good! Life is a stage where every second of it is always a performance! Everyone is an actor, everyone has been cast in a role, and everyone has an obligation to say great lines! Are there lines of dialogue that don't stick in your mind? Is it an act? Is there any such thing!]

What words would he have to say to a stranger to get them to notice him?
How many times would he have to extend his hand to a stranger to get them to remember him?

If he wanted to get the other person's attention, if he wanted to touch the soul of the other person, he would first have to go from being strangers to knowing each other.

He knew of the best way to let others know who he was.

???: [My name’s Emilia, just Emilia.]

Yes, that's right. That's also right. It's not you. It's not you. It's not me nor me.
 
――This was a dialogue between Natsuki Subaru and Sphinx.

Subaru: [――Sphinx.]

It was not just a random call to touch a soul, but a call to get the other person's attention.

The sound was different from before, the Witch ――or rather, the woman was walking, crossing, and drifting to escape from him in the wide desert, in the unknown world, and in the great ocean, and he could see her notice him.

Subaru: [――――]

She was so close to him that he could almost feel her breath, but for the first time, her eyes locked with his.

No matter what they looked like, you could not ignore their heart, or you would be unable to touch their deepest place.
 
Let us now try such natural communication at the Empire's final battle.

Subaru: [My name is Natsuki Subaru; I’m named after a star. ――What's yours?]

△▼△▼△▼△

The assortment of three Yang Swords that lay beyond the realm of reason, and the Giant Magic Crystal Soldier standing in the way of the Empire’s tomorrow.

Each concealing extraordinary power as they clashed against one another, and the setting sun befalling the Empire was overturned by the sun upon the surface that rejected all notions of dusk, its radiance shining light upon the whole Imperial Capital.

Giant Soldier: [――――]

The magic crystals sinisterly gleamed, and their unleashed light of destruction colored the streets of the Imperial Capital in darkness, but, without having exchanged any words, the Sword Wolves had scattered to three different directions, and managed to evade it in an agile manner.

The vegetation and flowers that had basked in the shadowy light of the Giant Magic Crystal Soldier were brought into a state of suspended life, and in the midst of that, the King of Thorns dashed up to the rooftop of a building, and targeted the leg of the inorganic golem that was the Giant Soldier. 

The dazzling brandish of the sword moved to mow down the defenseless leg of the Giant Soldier―― it was deflected by a firm impact.

???: [Hoh, so you were shy enough to cover up your bare skin?]

Protected by the sword of her ancestor, the King of Thorns, the Sun Princess laughed. Her crimson eyes had ascertained the deployment of white cloth weaved with Mana to protect the colossal body of the Giant Magic Crystal Soldier.

Unlike the Steelman Moguro Hagane, was it not rather a Witch or a woman who would clad themselves in clothes?

???: [Ready yourselves!]

Contrasting the Sun Princess as she laughed so, the Wise Emperor shouted with a rigid expression.

Immediately after, an enormous shimmering sword sliced down, and its afterglow attempted to hunt down the enemy bustling about its legs, tearing through and reshaping the streets of the Imperial Capital in the range of over one kilometer.

That act had been performed by a pillar of magic crystals held in the arm of the Giant Magic Crystal Soldier.

It was one of the pillars that had been constructed around the Crystal Palace at a height matching that of the Giant Soldier’s, and as it was transformed into a deadly greatsword with a blade of fifty meters, its sense of scale was such that it would not lose out to the Yang Sword.

However――,

Sun Princess: [Very well. Flashiness is to mine liking.]

Thrusting the Yang Sword into the blade of the brandished magic crystal greatsword , the Sun Princess rode upon it.

The swung tip of the sword was raised to a height of over one hundred meters off the ground, so she glared into the head of the Giant Soldier―― the former battery of the Magic Crystal Cannon, and the site that had become the current throne of the Witch.

The throne had become like a closed flower bud of magic crystals, and she was unable to make direct eye contact with the Witch.

In that case, until she could tempt the Witch to look at herself――,

Sun Princess: [How about I show you some dazzling entertahinmunt!?]

That instant, in response to the scintillation of the Yang Sword, the magic crystal greatsword in the Giant Soldier’s hand burst into flames in the blink of an eye.

With the purple swell of an inferno, the fifty meter long pillar of magical essence turned into light, dazzling the eyes of the world.

Of course, by burning the greatsword, she had lost her foothold, so the Sun Princess was falling headfirst towards the ground―― extending a white arm towards the heavens, the heavenly maiden caught the Sun Princess out of the sky with a flap of her wings of fire.

Sun Princess: [It is a great service.]

The praise of the Sun Princess produced a smile upon the heavenly maiden’s cheeks, and gave power to her heart. As the two soared through the sky pulling the bands of light behind them, the Giant Magic Crystal Soldier drew out a second greatsword, and moved in an attempt to slash forth――,

King of Thorns: [It is to Mine Star and mine peoples, that I dedicate this brandish――]

Wise Emperor: [Do not look down upon the apex of the Sword Wolves!]

Aiming for the slender torso of the Giant Soldier, two streaks of swordlight slashed obliquely upwards from its left and right.

The combination technique of the King of Thorns and the Wise Emperor destroyed the cloth designed to protect the body of the Giant Soldier head on, and with a white flash, the swords were relentlessly driven into its large body.

As the treasured swords struck the magic crystals, a pleasant tune of shattering resounded through the skies of the Imperial Capital as if a scream from the Giant Soldier.

Giant Soldier: [――――]

Making a creaking noise, the greatsword shattered, and the entire body of the Giant Magic Crystal Soldier began to fissure. While that was proof that it was being cornered by extraordinary beings, it was also the impetus for the Giant Soldier to revise its fighting style.

Through the countless cracks formed throughout its body began to shine, and in the next moment, aiming in every direction with quite literally no blind spots, the rain of light―― nay, the undodgeable mist of light was unleashed.

If it was raindrops, then there was the Sword Saint, Blue Lightning, and Admirer who could evade it.

But, if that were to become particles of mist, then even those transcendent beings would have trouble evading.

Therefore――,

Wise Emperor: [――Yang Sword, Vollachia.]
Sun Princess: [――Yang Sword, Vollachia.]
King of Thorns: [――Yang Sword, Vollachia.]

One point in the sky and two points on the groundl; for a total of three points, the treasured swords of crimson, which had increased their radiance, birthed a wall of flame. By means of a scintillating flame that scorched anything it made contact with, the misty drizzle of light that gouged out anything it made contact with was painted over.

They had defended against the Witch’s destruction, however, the fissures throughout the body of the Giant Magic Crystal Soldier expanded, and just as a snake would shed its old skin, the Giant Soldier exfoliated a purple gleam, and its radiance grew a level deeper.

As to not allow the Giant Magic Crystal Soldier fire off its next move, an undulation of power differing to that of the Yang Sword spread out―― slowly, as if giant unseen fists were being drawn out of the ground, the buildings that made up the cityscape of the Imperial Capital rose out of the ground;  ten, twenty, nearing a total of one-hundred, they surrounded the Giant Soldier.

The one who had done that, was the heavenly maiden who was holding the Sun Princess with one arm, and directing the other towards the Giant Soldier――,

Heavenly Maiden: [I, am the princess’s dog.]

Sun Princess: [‘Tis a fine attitude.]

Immediately after, the maelstrom of buildings swirled, storming towards the body of the Giant Magic Crystal Soldier as if to sink its teeth into it.

In response to that tempest, the Giant Soldier reach out and grabbed a magic crystal pillar in each of its arms, and taking a dual-wielding stance of greatswords, the colossal body began to rapidly gyrate above the waist―― it performed a sword dance of destruction, ruination, and pulverization.

As an exceedingly mighty sword dance, it not only cleared away the onslaught of buildings, but also became a tornado loaded with the mist of light, attempting a triumphant return to the Imperial Capital of Lupugana.

Wise Emperor: [Just how many times in this day am I to witness the end of this world?]

Before the unimaginable storm of swords, the Wise Emperor heaved a sigh, however, moving forward with his sable gaze not the slightest bit deterred, he put his blade against the gale devastating the Imperial Capital, the Empire, and the entire world.

Simultaneously, the blades of the Sun Princess and the King of Thorns overlapped with the Wise Emperor’s aim, and together, they brought the tempest of swords to a halt.

Wise Emperor: [――Hk.]

Blood spilling from his lips as he grit his teeth, the Wise Emperor took on the burden of splendor as he held his ground. Appearing before the two who had similarly defended against the sword storm, the resonance of light and power began to engulf the tempest of swords in flames.

The tornado clad in violet light was scorched by the flame of the Yang Sword, and gradually shifted in color. The droplets of mist within the blade maelstrom began to spark, and before long it was transformed into a pillar of fire tall enough to pierce the heavens.

It was superb to the utmost degree. To think such a thing could be accomplished by the incomplete Yang Sword, unable to display its true value――,

Wise Emperor: [――――]

Tightly grasping the Yang Sword, the Wise Emperor narrowed his eyes at the rising pillar of fire. He stood before the brilliant blaze of flame, the force of its fire having strengthened by a noticeable amount.

He had done so while fully understanding that in the midst of battle, halting one’s legs and diverting one's attention to act of thinking was a foolish deed.

Immediately afterwards――,

???: [――Love me.]

The scorched sword tempest of light was perforated, and the Giant Magic Crystal Soldier, without any time for respite, jumped out. The brandish of the Giant Soldier’s greatsword, was parried by the kick of a tall geta.

A beat later, basking in the resultant gust of wind, and switching over to brilliant manner of beauty and dance as she waved the hem of her kimono mid-air, was the Flamboyant, harboring a flame in one of her eyes.

Flamboyant: [――――]

Still targeting the Flamboyant, who was unable to move in the midst of the air, the Giant Soldier attempted to scythe upwards with the greatsword opposite to the one that had been parried. However, that too, would not connect.

King of Thorns: [I shan’t allow thee to lay hands on Mine Star so easily.]

The intervening King of Thorns swept the Flamboyant into his arms, and receiving the attack head-on with the vertical stance of his Yang Sword, he blazingly cut through the blade of the greatsword.

The sequel to “Iris and the King of Thorns”, resurrected in the present day; as a result of that, the tip of the greatsword bounced off the ground, and damaged the Imperial Capital as it flew from north to south.

Immediately after their attention had been turned to the south of the Imperial Capital―― a white light beamed north through the city.

???: [――――PREAHHHHHH!]

In the southern sky, flapping its white wings, the Dragon, clad in the very essence of an overcast sky, roared.

Disregarding the values of life and death, the Cloud Dragon who only fought for the sake of their beloved changed sides, sending forth a breath in opposition to the ruination.

Taking that head-on, the Giant Magic Crystal Soldier was knocked back a great deal. Being pushed back, the Giant Soldier thrust its sharp feet into the street and held its ground; resonating with the remaining magic crystal pillar, a shrill noise was produced as the pillar was shattered into countless small swords, and they began to setup a formation of swords so as to protect the Giant Soldier in a manner similar to the white cloth from earlier. 

Even now, the Witch’s, the Great Disaster’s will to fight had yet to back down. In that case, the same could be said for this side.

Wise Emperor: [――――]

Present at the absolute center of the Vollachian Empire’s all-out war, the Wise Emperor slightly directed his attention outside.

Even if he was limited in ability, even if he was aware that he was a weak individual who would easily be blown away, the man who could not bear the idea of not going to the locations where people were staking their lives had not turned up.

Wise Emperor: [No matter the case, it is likely that you have also gone and thrown yourself into a reckless battle.]

Placing a certain sort of trust and expectation into his words, the Wise Emperor heightened the radiance of his treasured sword, and as he glared at the Giant Magic Crystal Soldier brimming with insidiousness, he stepped forth.

Wise Emperor: [Advance, O Generals of mine selection. ――In the eyes of the Great Disaster, we are naught more than inconsequential garbage.]

△▼△▼△▼△

――Natsuki Subaru and Spica faced off against the Witch, Sphinx.

As Subaru and Spica strove to seize the soul of the vindictive and tenacious Witch, Al's mission was to keep the enemy at bay so as to prevent any interference.

???: [Ah, bring it on! Ain’t nobody gonna beat me or the Princess!]

Spurring himself on while roaring thus, Al continued to swing his improvised dao.

Behind Al, Sphinx was seated with her back against the wall, and flumped before her with his legs crossed was Subaru, who remained facing her head-on.

What Subaru was attempting to do in cooperation with Spica was an idea beyond the pale even for Al.  

Hearing of the terrible idea of relying on the Authority of Gluttony had made Al question their sanity, but in fact, discerning that Subaru would be able to do it, Priscilla had ordered them to proceed.

If that is what would lead to the future, then Al would support them to his utmost. And ensure that it was achieved.

???: [Ul Goa.]

From above Al’s head, Roswaal flying freely across the sky rained down fire.

Though it was not the highest level of magic, casting that much magic in rapid succession was no ordinary feat. However, even his extraordinary magical prowess was unable to overwhelm the opponent he was presently attempting to restrain.

???: [Ul Huma.]

Countering the pouring rain of fire, was a barrage of water that had been shot into the sky from the ground.

In terms of number and effective range, both being the world’s top-class users, this was magical warfare at a level rarely seen in modern times――The Magician and the Witch each having sided with the world, turned the world against each other, and used each other’s world as their own.

Though Priscilla had vociferously asserted her presence, it was not the case that all the Witches had been drawn to her like moths to a flame. Some of the Witches, realizing that the Yang Sword was not the only thing they needed to fear, had joined in this juncture.

However――,                             

???: [If that’s how it is, so be it, in fact!]

With the appearance of a young girl and the movements of an athlete, Beatrice, with her right eye aflame, had cast Yin magic. 

Instantly, her upraised hands birthed a pale purple haze over the whole area, slowing down the movements of the attacking Witches as well as the undead that, lacking self-awareness, had impulsively charged forth upon her command.

Al took advantage of that nice assist from Beatrice with great vigor.

Al: [Your stars were bad indeed!]

The exquisite magic control weakened the enemy, bestowing a period of invincibility solely upon Al. As he beheaded the pitiable undead one after the other, at Beatrice who had supported him, Al winked through his helmet.

That very moment, at the wink that should not have been visible to her, Beatrice had a change of expression.

Beatrice: [This is bad, I suppose!]

At her words, Al turned around with a "Huh?", and saw something――a massive fragment with a purple glow, in the scale of tens of meters, hurtling towards them as it bounced off the ground.

Al had no idea that this was the slashed-off tip of the great sword wielded by the Giant Magic Crystal Soldier that Priscilla and the others were fighting. What he did know, was that a direct hit from that fragment, would result in Al along with Subaru and the others behind him altogether becoming minced meat――,

Al: [Must――]

Escape with Subaru and the others from the trajectory of the flying fragment.

How many attempts would be needed, he did not know, and neither did he have the time to make such an estimation. Everything was more of trial and error at the precipice of life and death rather than a theoretical treatise. 

Al: [Matrix Update, Thought Experiment――]

???: [――Don't'cha give up jus’ like that!!]

A moment later, passing by Al, a powerful arm plunged into the fragment, intercepting it.

A roar and a torrential wind escaped behind him, but the flying debris was held in place. It was Garfiel who did it, biting his sharp canine teeth.

Garfiel: [Sorry for being late, Beatrice! Captain…]

Beatrice: [ You did well meeting us in fact! Protecting Subaru and Spica is our win condition I suppose.]

Garfiel: [Ha! That’s easy to understand. Just like, “If you whisper of love, follow the King of Thorns.”]

Kicking at the huge piece of debris that he had stopped, Garfiel punched his fists together in front of his chest. Garfiel also had his eyes, not figuratively but literally, burning and his whole body was filled with vigor in response to his will to fight.

Witch: [ Retreat: Required.]

A quiet voice announced the Witch's entry into the war, and Al and the others looked up to see a scene of swirling lights in the sky. The vortex of light had some kind of gravitational pull, and the surrounding buildings and debris floated up, were swallowed by the vortex, and then was crushed and turned into light dust.

The power of destruction was felt in the light dust itself, and with a voice from the Witch, it was able to equalize the ground――

Tanza: [ Halibel-sama, please would you kindly,]

Halibel: [That's fine. I'm always happy to help a hard working girl.]

Suddenly, two different voices were heard, and in the next moment, a cannonball in a kimono――no, a deer girl, flew by.

The girl spun herself in the air and kicked the Witch's back as she was on the verge of raining light dust. The momentum and force of the kick shattered the poor Witch in half.

Halibel: [Yea, yea, that's a great feat. With a girl like you, the future of the Empire is secure.]

With the same momentum, the girl was about to dive into the vortex of light but was saved just in time by the jet black wolf man.

The wolf man rendered harmless the vortex of light the Witch had prepared with a quick piercing hand, softly catching the girl with the same hand that did so, and then descended to the ground.

The same wolf man who threw the girl and the same wolf man who caught her was responsible for her confusion.

Tanza: [A new monster has been added! A Cecilus type!?]

Halibel: [Can't deny that, but that's an unpleasant classification.]

Tanza: [It has been a while. I am sorry to be presumptuous, Cecilus-sama and Halibel-sama are very different in their nature that it would be disrespectful.――Why don't we protect Schwartz-sama?]

Al: [Oh, oh. You're quick on the uptake! And I'll definitely welcome strong guys.Let's protect Bro together!]

Halibel: [Yea. Looks like we’re almost at endgame, and it looks like we even received this gift.]

Tanza, a girl in a kimono seen in the Demon City――greeted the wolf man Halibel. Both of them have Priscilla's blessing in their eyes as a flame, which was very encouraging.

Additionally――,

Beatrice: [I don't know where this came from or who, but I just received the perfect souvenir, in fact.]

Saying this, Beatrice touched a huge piece of debris with her small palm.――The rubble that Garfiel had stopped, it was not just a piece of rubble, but a block of magic crystal stone.

Beatrice disassembled it into mana in one breath, and about a hundred swords made of amethyst crystals appeared all around her at once, and the sword dance began with the movement of her hand as she lifted it.

Beatrice: [Betty will use her abundant mana in this way, I suppose. You guys, if you even scratch Subaru, you will be mercilessly punished, in fact.]

Tanza: [If that were to happen, I will be the one to deliver Beatrice-sama's punishment!]

Al shrugged when he saw both Beatrice and Tanza's sparking gazes.

――Apparently, Subaru's unharmed state should also be included in the updated matrix’s conditions, he thought.

△▼△▼△▼△

Thus, protected by Al and the others, Subaru is in the midst of extreme concentration.

He was not unconscious, nor was he in a dream. Nevertheless, the battle going on around him was outside his awareness, and his awareness was not of the Imperial Capital.

Currently, Natsuki Subaru's existence is not on the battlefield of Imperial Capital, but in a white world where there existed only himself, Spica, who was holding his hand, and Sphinx, who was looking directly at him.

――It was a space that could easily be mistaken for the Hall of Memories.

Subaru: [I suppose for me, this is mainly a place of bad memories.]

It was a place where he arrived unintentionally and where his memories were forcibly consumed.

It was fresh in my mind that he gave Emilia and Beatrice a hell of a lot of hard time and made a mess of Ram and Julius.

Above all, this is the place where "Natsuki Subaru" disappeared.

Subaru: [But that's the whole reason why I am here.]

Spica: [U?]

Subaru: [You don't need to know about this place. It's a bit of a mess as far as you're concerned. And that’s fine.]

Subaru smiled at Spica's puzzled expression, and then drew in a deep breath.

Subaru met Spica and Sphinx in this white, tranquil space, not because they were all friends whose names began with the letter S. 

This was because all of them had close connections with "themselves" and wanted to talk in private with them.

Witch: [Sphinx was the name of the monster that was in my creator's knowledge.]

Subaru: [Hm? Oh, that's how you got your name.]

Witch: [Yes. If my creator's wishes had been fulfilled from the beginning, I would have been named Echidna. Since that did not happen, it became necessary to have another name.]

Directly facing him, Sphinx was surprisingly calm and told Subaru about her origins.

Sphinx --as Subaru knew it, was a monster with the body of a lion and the head of a man. It guarded the pyramids and gave the impression that it was good at giving riddles.

Subaru: [What goes on four feet in the morning, two feet in midday, and three feet in the evening?… Do you know what this is?]

Witch: [――? A monster? Or a shape-shifting monster, perhaps.]

Subaru: [You'd think so. And by the way, the answer is man.]

When he told them a traditional riddle, both Sphinx and Spica looked at him with reluctance. They were not convinced, but he would have liked to direct their complaints to a different Sphinx who presented the riddle.

In any case――,

Subaru: [Thanks for letting me know. In exchange, I have something to show you, too.]

Witch: [What do you want me to see?]

Subaru: [Yeah. ――Although I'm not sure if you'll be happy with it.]

After that preface, Subaru smiled a little and then glanced at Spica. As if to allay Subaru's fears, she lifted her hand, still clasped in hers, and said, "U!".

This was Spica's way of saying they had come to terms with "themself" a step ahead of Subaru.

――When he closed his eyes in the "Hall of Memories," he could strongly smell his own scent.

He has heard that there is a strong connection between memories and smells. Many memories are associated with smells, which may be why the Hall of Memories gave such an impression.

In either case, Subaru slowly tried to follow his own scent and walk through the unreal Hall of Memories to bring the uncertain to the certain.

In one of the many Return by Death attempts, Olbart, who had lost both arms, apologized in a casual tone of voice for the difficulty in undoing his infantilization ――So instead of an apology, Subaru asked for guidance. 

The vessel and the soul were eager to return. Now all that there was left to do was to use smell as a guide to lead them.

If he did that――,

Subaru: [――My name is Natsuki Subaru. The one and only, broke beyond compare in the world and heaven.]

Yes, the voice, which was making trivial remarks, became a little deeper and lower. His eye level changed, and the feel of Spica's hand in his grip suddenly felt smaller and smaller.

However, it was the opposite: Spica did not shrink. ――Subaru changed.

Subaru: [――――]

A sensory, change. His soul was in a constant state of seeking to return to its own original form.

The feeling of accomplishment, like the growing pains in the heart and soul, having literally grown from a child to an adult, seeped through Subaru's blood vessels and nerves and into every cell of the body.

And so, having regained a solid sense of self, Subaru once again faced Sphinx ――or rather, faced Sphinx head-on for the first time.

Witch: [――Nice to meet you, Natsuki Subaru.]

Having observed the change, Sphinx, following Subaru's intention, greeted him for the first time. Upon hearing that, Subaru thought that maybe they were the one who could talk.

Natsuki Subaru thought so with his now restored mind, body, heart, and soul.

Subaru: [But we have to settle things.]

Witch: [Yes, we do.――Parting: Required.]

Subaru: […Why is that?]

Witch: [Why, what do you mean why?]

Subaru: [Why are you trying to do it all on your own?]

That was Subaru's honest question.

The Witch Sphinx caused the "Great Disaster" that destroyed the Vollachian Empire, tampered with many lives, and did many things that would have otherwise been unforgivable. But was it necessary to do so?

If the Sphinx's only purpose was to reproduce her creator ――the Witch of Greed.

Subaru: [You could have done it a different way. You made mistakes in the way you did things. If only you hadn't done it the wrong way, we could have,]

Witch: [You think we could have avoided fighting? That would have been impossible. Reconsideration: Required.]

Subaru: [Why not!]

Witch: [Because there is a certain reason, other than the reproduction of my creator, that is in me.]

Sphinx looked down at herself, smiled faintly, and proclaimed a crucial difference.

Subaru could see the smile, a sign that Sphinx was congratulating herself, and he could no longer resist.

But at the same time, Natsuki Subaru definitely, clearly, found it.

Spica: [Uau.]

Subaru: [Yeah, I know. ――Thanks, Spica.]

Spica called out to Subaru, who bit his lip. She probably would have liked to react to Subaru returning to his original size, but she held back and was considerate.

He wanted to respond to that desire. ――Even if he had to go to hell to do so.

Subaru: [――Sphinx.]

Witch: [What is it? I don't care what――]

Subaru: [Happy Birthday.]

With that said, he touched Sphinx, whose eyes opened at the unfamiliar congratulation.

And then――,

△▼△▼△▼△

Basking in the wind carrying a pleasant evening fragrance, Priscilla gave her cheers to existence.

She had been elated by the dinner banquet between Sphinx, who, using the mechanisms of the Crystal Palace Meteor, had gone berserk with the upstood Giant Magic Crystal Soldier, and the Generals who had been assembled by Vincent.

She wished to continue beholding it as a dream that one would not wake up from, as a program that would not come to a close, as a story with no “<u>endhing</u>”.

However, since that childish “<u>iigo</u>” was not appropriate for the curtain falling on this battle――,

Priscilla: [In a manner most befitting, it is I who shall lower the curtain.]

Saying that, Priscilla let go of Arakiya’s hand as they flew above the clouds, and began falling through the sky.

Plummeting straight downwards, Priscilla returned the Yang Sword to the sheath of the sky, and basking in the setting sun with her arms spread out, she closed her eyes.

Even if she could not see them, the souls of those whom she had shared the flame of her soul with were transmitted to her as if whispered intimacies from the world.

Arakiya, clad in bands of light, repelled  the Witch’s magic, and the Dragon, covered in armor of cumulus, contained her so that the damage would not spread outside of the city. Standing harmoniously with the husband she had reunited with, Yorna was busy smashing up the ground in a radical expression of love, having no hesitations about possessing her daughter’s eye.

And, as an incompetent older brother, the Vollachian Emperor, Vincent Vollachia――,

Vincent: [Tardy.]

With a brief utterance, he looked up at the Giant Magic Crystal Soldier undaunted with his sable eyes. The Giant Soldier raised its two magic crystal greatswords overhead, and was about to attempt cutting down the apex of the Empire along with the entire Imperial Capital.

Thereupon, Lightning came piercing through from behind Vincent――,

???: [――Bear witness, Observers of the heavens above. ――Witness the choices the world shall… Nay! Witness as it chooses me!]

Two streaks, one the white gleam of a blade, and the other a black light of severance, the flash of blades capable of severing the light of stars and the logic of curses bolted through the sky.

With that, the omen of the Imperial Capital’s devastation that was the Giant Magic Crystal Soldier had its arms lopped off from its shoulders. With a thundering tremor and eruption of smoke, the brilliance of the magic crystals was reduced to dust, and the flash of Dream Sword and Fiend Sword severed their existence.

Even so, the Giant Soldier, having lost its arms, was still wielding the countless swords floating in its vicinity, and was attempting to prune the defiant will of the Empire.

Of course, that aim included the falling Priscilla.

???: [――Priscilla Barielle.]

Enough to paint over the hue of the sky, the light of ruination forcibly shone through her eyelids. Sensing that it	approaching herself, Priscilla opened her eyes, and reached her hands ought to her left and right sides.

The next instant, Priscilla caught the Yang Swords of the Wise Emperor and the King of Thorns in her right and left hands respectively, and with a swing of the twin swords, she scorched the Witch’s magic crystal swords to naught in one fell swoop. The swords, bursting into flames in a chain reaction, swirled around the Giant Magic Crystal Soldier, blanketing the sky in a crimson curtain of flame.

Priscilla: [――――]

For a moment, Priscilla’s figure disappeared from everybody’s sight―― the figure of the Sun Princess perforated the curtain of flame, and shot directly towards the sealed magic crystal bud within the Giant Magic Crystal Soldier’s head.

It was an act accomplished thanks to the three Yang Swords―― riding upon her own Yang Sword, which had been launched out of the sheath of the sky, Priscilla soared with the Yang Swords of her brother and forefather in hand.

――The Yang Sword upon which Priscilla rode, its tip thrust into the magic crystal bud, tearing through the closed flower petals and making its way inside.

???: [――Priscilla Barielle.]

That instant, the barrage of light orbs intended to intercept her, was cleared away by the King of Thorns’s Yang Sword.

As flame enshrouded her field of vision, Priscilla stepped down to the floor and advanced.

???: [――Priscilla Barielle.]

Simultaneously, stepping past the flames enshrouding her vision, Sphinx rushed out with a sword of light in hand.

The two met gazes, and Priscilla burned away her opponent’s sword with the Wise Emperor’s Yang Sword.

Sphinx: [――Priscilla Barielle.]

Eyes burning with fury, Sphinx had called her name many times, to which Priscilla smiled. Perceiving that smile in her vision, Sphinx leaped backwards, and readied her two hands.

Birthing ten blades of light upon her fingers, she rampaged about within the bud; irregularly reflecting off the inside of the magic crystals, the kaleidoscope of Death gleamed with beauty.

At the chaotic and emotional scintillation, Pirscilla raised both her hands towards the heavens.

Then, gripping the treasured sword protruding beyond her outstretched hands――,

Sphinx: [――PRISCILLA BARIELLE!]

Priscilla: [That is mine name.]

Within the sonorous bellow of that voice, there was a certain heat tinged with enmity. Thereupon, Priscilla swung down the brilliant dazzling Yang Sword.

――The flash of scintillating flame, that light reminiscent of sunrise or daybreak, of a new dawn, ardently shone upon her life. As the interior of the magic crystal bud was illuminated, it began to bloom.

That was to say, the sprouting of a soul――,

Priscilla: [Stand tall, Sphinx.]

Sphinx: [――――]

Priscilla: [As none other than your very self, you fulfilled the role of mine enemy. ――It is a great service.]

Adjusting her posture after swinging the Yang Sword, Priscilla spoke thus to Sphinx, who was standing in front of her. Receiving that, Sphinx narrowed her black eyes, and,

Sphinx: […Despite having failed to succeed, is that so?]

Priscilla: [A matter of course. Just who do you take mineself for?]

Scoffing at the question, Priscilla responded so.

At her answer, Sphinx lowered the edges of her eyebrows, and heaving a sigh with an expression that had lost its sternness,

Sphinx: [Priscilla Barielle. ――The fateful enemy of myself, the Great Disaster, Sphinx.]

As a being who had found meaning in her existence differing to the original reason for which she had been created, she smiled.

――That was the conclusion between the Sun Princess, Priscilla Barielle, and the Great Disaster, Sphinx.

△▼△▼△▼△

Once, before, they were nearly dead.

Even then, there was a goal that could not be fulfilled, but they accepted it without equanimity that in that end, they would not reach it, and their heart felt as calm and worthless as though it were joining in the evening’s setting sun.

So now, what about now?

???: [Just like before, I will disappear without fulfilling my wish――]

Their heart was like that of a child longing not for the setting sun but for the rising one, and could feel a certain heat burning in their chest, pulsing through their un-beating body.

And then, they were told that this was the true nature of the horrible "heat" that had dazzled in the eyes of the cold and parched monster in that place where they had been bound to for decades.

???: [Thank you. For teaching me who I am. ――Gratitude: Required.]

An ill-defined, uncertain, and ambiguous self is formed as themself, which is far from what they had originally wanted to become, and yet they did not dislike it.
 
Once again, it can be said. This newly born existence as a monster was not a replacement for the Witch of Greed.
 
So now that they were disappearing without their own personal wishes fulfilled, they spoke.

???: [――Ahh, how frustrating.]

△▼△▼△▼△

???: [――Sphinx.]

Subaru called out her name, and Spica, having touched her soul, had devoured her existence.

The moment Star Eating activated, welling up within Subaru was a mellow sense of satisfaction and accomplishment, along with a feeling of loneliness. It was perhaps, something like the kind of loneliness felt at the end of a meal filled with laughter.

Truly fulfilling, and yet slightly lacking, it was that kind of a moment.

???: [――――]

He had congratulated her on her birth as one life, and with that same mouth he had helped devour her.

However, it was not out of hatred. To make her suffer, or to disappoint her, he had not wanted to do either. There just was no other way to conclude this. 

The resolution between Subaru’s group and Sphinx, this was the only way it could be.

???: [U!]

Rustling, Sphinx turned to dust and disappeared. As he witnessed her demise, Spica, who had brought it about with Subaru, called out to him.

To Spica, words of gratitude and appreciation must be given.

Subaru: [Besides, that the enemy leader is no more, Abel and the others also――]

As he attempted to stand up while he spoke.

???: [――Subaru.]

The voice, heard unexpectedly, ignored Subaru's eardrums and cranium, and resonated directly into his brain.

It had always been like that. That beautiful silver-bell like voice, always laid Natsuki Subaru bare. And having made the bared Subaru turn around, it had brought with it the urge to burst into tears.

Subaru: [――――]

Unable to speak, as Subaru stood up and turned around, the glow of the setting sun shone into his eyes. That sunset, which had brought with it the afterglow of victory, had become a hindrance. ――For within that light, there was a face he longed to see.

Her long silver hair that resembled the dew drops of a night sky’s moon, her eyes of amethyst, the most beautiful jewel in the world, from the top of her head to the tips of her toes, there was not one bit that he did not find lovely.

Spica: [Uau.]

Subaru was almost in tears from the longing that had welled up within him, and Spica, who had let go of his hand, patted him on the back.

With the touch of that palm providing the opportunity and the courage, Subaru started to run.

He passed by Al who gave him a thumbs up, he sent a thankful gaze at the purple smoke puffing Halibel, he patted the shoulders of Garfiel who was balling his eyes out in Subaru’s stead, he poked the cheek of Beatrice as she held back her urge to jump onto him, and he smiled wryly at Tanza who had bowed deeply, after which Roswaal, who had descended from the sky, took off his jacket and draped it over him.

???: [Subaru-kun, aren’t you compleeetly~ naked.]

Having grown back, Subaru's clothes from his infantile state not longer fit. If this had been his original world, it would be like not having the clothes to go buy clothes. 

But this was not his original world, this was another world, the one in which Subaru now lived.

Emilia: [Suba――]

The girl who had broken into a jog to rush over to him from the other direction was about to call out, but Subaru, without slowing down, went ahead and embraced her, rendering her silent. 

With his arms now at their proper original size, he tightly hugged her slender body――,

Subaru: [――EMT.]

Emilia: […Idiot.]

Subaru had embraced her head-on, and Emilia, who was slightly surprised, smiled knowing that there was no helping it.

Their reunion in the Vollachian Empire had, of course, been exhilarating. Upon reuniting with her after being separated, Subaru had truly realized the depth of his feelings for her.

But, this time was, after all, different. ――This time, Natsuki Subaru was whole, mind, body and soul. 

Emilia: [Welcome back, Subaru.]

Subaru: [Yeah. ――I’m back, Emilia-tan.]

Emilia, who had sensed that same fulfillment of Subaru’s soul, spoke thus.

And then, beyond the two sharing in the joy of their reunion, the dazzling Crystal Palace, had burst into flames. 

 ――For the long, long-drawn Great Disaster of the Vollachian Empire, that was the closing ceremony.
