*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

???: [――You have a use. You will be used to help me, to fulfill my desires.]

Those were the first words the man spoke to them, and they symbolized the relationship between him and them, which never once changed until the very end.

The man and them had spent decades together.

During that time, they were never given freedom, amounting to being shackled and confined in a basement.

Although he had a caretaker to keep them from dying, the cautious man would silence and replace them periodically, so the man was the only one whom they could say they had any contact with over the decades.

 ――Leip Barielle.

He is a nobleman of the Dragonfriend Kingdom of Lugunica, a man ruled by what is, to put it simply, an ugly ambition.

During the Demi-Human War, the Barielle family had been commissioned as viscounts, but they forfeited their titles and were demoted to barons when they were forced to take responsibility for their defeat during the civil war.

If that humiliation and anger were the driving force behind Leip's actions, then one would have to wonder how long human anger and hatred can retain its intensity.

Leip would constantly remind himself of the humiliation of decades ago as if it were only yesterday.

Leip: [Eventually, I will certainly make use of you. You are alive because of me. Best to not forget that.]

Human beings, within their knowledge, have a thing called emotion.

For example, if you spend ten or twenty years with someone, even if you do nott like their personality or relationship, their attitude will soften, and the harshness of their contact will dissipate.

However, that was not the case with Leip. There was always a fresh sense of hostility from him.

Not once were warm words ever spoken to them.
 
They did not know Leip's personal history, family makeup, or any of the Barielle family's affairs.

Day after day, they spend long, quiet, and idle time in captivity, only to be told by Leip's occasional visits about the current state of affairs in the Kingdom and the unchanging days of lying in wait.

However, on one occasion, they had a different conversation with Leip.

Leip: [You led the civil war in collusion with demi-humans. What was your purpose?]

More than twenty years had already passed since the Demi-Human War, and it was a topic already too late to talk about now.

Leip asked this question at a time when both Valga and Libre, who had fought with them, had already died, and the major figures of the Demi-human Coalition at the time were all gone.

They did not ask why he wanted to know that.

They had a feeling that if they asked questions back, Leip would be taken aback and the topic itself would be closed. Therefore, they did not say anything unnecessary and did not feel the need to hide their purpose, so they spoke frankly.

Their cooperation in the "Demi-Human War" was to fulfill the purpose of their own creation.

Leip: [――Rubbish.]

Upon hearing that the Demi-Human War was part of the process of trying to achieve the purpose of their creation, something they have been pursuing for more than a century, Leip dismissed the idea with disdainful dismissal.

They did not feel any anger or sadness from Leip's reaction. They had always been that way, and Leip's reaction was as expected.

From the point of view of this ugly, ambitious man, all wishes other than his own were frivolous.

But――,

Leip: [You were born as yourself but want to become someone else? Why bother to pretend to live under someone else's name and way of life, only to let your own name die?]

That conversation, which they thought would be ended after being cut off and discarded, continued.

Leip turned toward them with eyes clouded with negative emotions, more frustrated than ever, as if to say that this was a truly repugnant idea.

Leip: [Your purpose is of no value. After all, you are to be used by me. A desire that is not worth a shred of anything even if you fulfill it. If you intend to squander it, give it to me.]

???: [You――]

Leip: [The purpose of your creation is nonsense. If you cannot live without someone telling you what to do, then be used for what I want.]

There was no righteous indignation or compassion in Leip's eyes as he spoke.

In Leip's clouded eyes was anger toward those who had brought about his undiminished humiliation, resentment, and hatred toward an era and a world that refused to acknowledge his existence, and an ambition, like a black flame, to push himself into a more deserved position.

They were so violent, as if they trampled them, as if they were pouring sludge on them, that they certainly plunged a blade into their being, tearing them apart and causing them to bleed cold blood.

――To fulfill the purpose of their creation, borne out of their creator.

That was the meaning of their life and the purpose of their long journey.

Yet, they had never once harbored a strong passion for that purpose. Never. Never once did they have a passion for it. Inertia and compromise without enthusiasm, the need to accomplish what was given to them because they had been given it, ruled their lives.

However, originally, was this not what a wish or a desire was meant to be?

Is it not true that to desire something strongly, to try to fulfill a wish that one wants to fulfill, is it not right that this should be the case?

Is Leip Barielle's way of being the right way to get what one wants?

???: [――――]

Moreover, a long time had passed. During that time, their relationship with Leip has remained unchanged.

Not many words were exchanged, and time ticked by without being prepared to take their role, for which they had been told they would be of used.

Then, eventually, there was a change.

Leip: [Finally, an opportunity seems to have presented itself.]

Indeed, Leip, whose eyes glowed bright and maniacally, had grown thin and gaunt, his face and body corroded by an age that could not be reversed, despite his undiminished ambition.

He was filled with joy that the time had finally come that he would be able to grasp the thread that hung in front of him, and that he would finally be rewarded even after he had restrained himself from even blinking.

According to what they had heard, Leip had established himself among the Royal Family of Lugunica over the past few decades and was entrusted with the management of the tablet of prophecies called the Dragon History Stone, which the Divine Dragon had given to the Kingdom.

Having grasped the fact that the prophetic tablet had been inscribed with information about a plague that would soon strike the Kingdom of Lugunica ――a disease that would spread through the royal family, Leip was eager for the next battle for the throne that would come afterward.

Leip: [I will find a candidate before anyone else. I will take her as my wife and send her to the Royal Selection… and I will surely win the throne. You, too, will be of use to me.]

With fists clenched tight with nothing but skin and bones, Leip was determined to do just that.

They had always been told that they would be of use, but now that it was feasible, even as someone who had been connected to them for several decades, there was a small sense of excitement. ――They had expectations.

When the opportunity arose, Leip would be accompanied by the candidate he had found and prepared a strategy to break the candidate's heart. He would then turn the candidate into a puppet and rule the next age of the Kingdom with his own hands.

Leip's ambition to mastermind such a scheme, to plot its realization with unusual tenacity, and to actually bring it to the brink of fruition was, for all intents and purposes, dark and dazzling.

They wanted it to come true. They wanted him to fulfill it. To follow that passion.

They wanted him to fulfill his ugly ambitions that would make anyone want to turn away, to use the Kingdom for his own desires, to use even a Witch as a springboard for his own desires, and to achieve his obsession.

That was what he wanted, for Sphinx to tell him that that was what he was missing.

So they waited. They kept waiting.

Leip was looking forward to breaking the heart of a woman he had married to take advantage as a candidate to participate in the Royal Selection.

They waited and waited and waited, but Leip never showed up.

To find out why he had not appeared, they broke the bonds that had not been broken for decades and ventured out on their own.

And it was only when they found out why Leip did not show up that they understood.

Sphinx: [――Huh.]

――This was the passion of wanting to accomplish something.

△▼△▼△▼△

Witch: [Countermeasures: Required ――no, prevent this if you can.]

Sphinx's trump card, her ace up her sleeve, her hidden trap were overturned.

Reflected upon the shimmering surface of the water mirror were the struggles of those who overcame the schemes prepared by the Witch one after another in an effort to keep the destruction of the Empire from coming.

???: [――――]

Crimson eyes narrowed, Priscilla, chained, looked at the mirrored surface and Sphinx's white face.

Desperate and drowning, Sphinx subjected themselves to the greatest burden in order to fulfill their own desires. The substance of this would be an abomination upon the world, upon the empire, and upon Vincent, but to Priscilla, it was not an abomination at all.

She did not wish for the downfall of the Empire or the world, nor for the tireless efforts of her own older brother, Vincent.

However, for the sake of the desired outcome, everything one did with all of oneself was beautiful.

Even when that hatred bordered on resentment was directed against them, it was no exception.

All things have their proportional value.

Those who lack the understanding of the size of their own vessel and desire more than it can hold are often doomed. However, Priscilla wisely spoke that she did not like those who could console themselves with only what they could fit in their vessels.

She wants to love the way of life of the fool who seeks what is beyond the capacity of their vessel, who goes on a path that may lead to ruin, who aims for the sun and gets their wings burned, regardless of whether they succeed or fail in their challenge.

Priscilla: [It is love.]

All those who would risk their lives on the battlefield would not believe their ears at Priscilla's words.

However, that was Priscilla's genuine intention. In the first place, Priscilla did not prefer to act or speak in ways that conspire and deceive others. She would never wish such a way of life on herself.

Hence, it was genuine praise.

All those who took up arms on this battlefield, lent their shoulders to others, shed their blood, and burned their souls, regardless of whether they were alive or dead, were to be loved.

If that could be true――,

Priscilla: [――A sentimentality that is uncharacteristic of mineself.]

Priscilla closed one eye, a rare grimace forming on her beautiful face.

Since childhood, she imitated her older brother when she contemplated. Vincent understood all too well the weight of the responsibility he bore, and never closed his eyes, not even when he slept.

That attitude was admirable, but excessive. ――Sometimes, there are others whom one can only see behind one's eyelids.

Priscilla: [You, as well, elder brother, find someone you can be with and shut both eyes with.]

Priscilla said this with respect to Vincent, who once destroyed the plans of the Witch who led the Great Disaster with the Yang Sword in his hands.

Then in the water mirror, Priscilla saw something that caught her eye.

――Aldebaran and Natsuki Subaru.

Priscilla's praiseworthy clown and the half-devil's knight who, despite the annoyance, was named a candidate for the Royal Selection.

Like Sphinx's perceived threat, Priscilla also understood their struggle ――something more than just a twist of the stars of fate.

Priscilla: [And what are you deceiving the Witch… nor, rather, the heavens?]

Sphinx, the mastermind behind the Great Disaster, was not half-hearted in her schemes.

The undead army created with the Sacrament of the Immortal King, the use of the Stone Muspel to realize them, the second coming as the Witch of Greed who once dodged the flame of the Yang Sword, the murderous intent toward Arakiya who shared her destiny with the lands of the Empire, the starlight and the Magic Crystal Cannon, the subsequent runaway of the magic core, the deployment of the magic circles to utilize the magic crystal stones, and the staging of the plight of the Fortified City――.

Who could have predicted that such well-orchestrated plans would be foiled at every turn?

This was simply impossible for The Wise Emperor Vincent Vollachia, his right-hand man The White Spider Chisha Gold, or Priscilla Barielle.

The destruction of the Vollachian Empire should have been unavoidable.

If it were not for those who broke through the dead-end of that fate with impossible strength.

That was why――,

Priscilla: [――Just one more move.]

Priscilla's lips spun as she peered at the scene that floated on the mirror's surface.

The massive water mirror above the Imperial Capital reflected the plight of the distant Fortified City and tried to break the will of those in the Imperial Capital to fight. ――The fire of doom, once swallowed by the void, was drowned out.
 
The starlight was cancelled out by the Magic Crystal Cannon, the pride of Imperial Capital, and the water mirror shattered.

At last, it seemed that all of Witch's plans had been thwarted.

However――,

Witch: [Not yet.]

Even the starlight over the Fortified City was drowned out, and even so, the Witch's all-encompassing plan was still not exhausted.

The Witch saw the mass-scale disaster she had prepared and that it had been prevented, but she used this as a springboard to set up a trap.

――The water mirror shattered in the sky, turned into raindrops, and poured down upon the entire Imperial Capital.

like a passing storm, it drenched the Imperial Capital, and raindrops struck the living and the dead alike.

And so, they were blades of water, the harmful disguised as the harmless.

Slowly, the drops that slide over the skin of those struck by raindrops shudder and then become blades. This danger loomed equally over everyone except the transcendent beings who were either inside buildings or who avoided the rain by instinctive intuition.

It is a deadly line that can no longer be avoided.

Priscilla: [――――]

Hence why, Priscilla closed her eyes.

Earlier, she had thought about Vincent, and then she did the same thing, behind her eyelids Priscilla saw many faces, many souls ――Schult, Heinkel, Emilia, Crusch, Felt, Anastasia, Serena, and Arakiya.

Vincent, Lamia, Rem, and Aldebaran were all also there.

All of them are just missing one more move.

Priscilla: [――The world is made for my convenience.]

Priscilla muttered that, and Sphinx's movement stopped as she tried to flash a blade of raindrops.

She looked at Priscilla through the water mirror, her black eyes wide.

In the next instant, the other space created to hold Priscilla collapsed. ――Quickly, it was engulfed by the unbearable radiant flames of the Sun Princess trapped within.

△▼△▼△▼△

The moment the starlight flashed over the Fortified City, everyone who looked up to the sky was speechless.

???: [――――]

This was right after they had succeeded in defeating the Blight Dragon that had attacked them just prior, and the fact that they had successfully defeated a powerful enemy together had boosted the morale of all the soldiers who were challenging the siege to their utmost.

However, before the fact that the undead's most powerful force had been destroyed was conveyed to all, the beautiful destruction loomed overhead, and many forgot the beating of their own hearts.

Of course, there were those who tried everything they could under the circumstances.

The same is true of the Spirit Knight clad in an aura of light, the female warriors who never lose their fighting spirit, the soldier with insects inside of him and the hulking frame armored in gold, and the battalion who assembled in the light of their own star.

Even the wise people who lacked the strength to fight, thought countless thoughts in the short space of time and spared no second to try to shatter their desperate predicament.

But still, just like ants gathered together to stop a giant, everything was to be trampled and reaped.

――Until the fire of destruction flew from the distant sky, collided with the light of the stars, and the world flashed white.

???: [――――]

No one knew what had happened immediately.

However, the retinas of those who did not look away were burned white, to reveal that the destruction that could have come before their eyesight returned had not descended upon them.

And then――,

???: [――Hk.]

The two lights, the white of the stars and the red of the fire, blended together and a shockwave covered the sky of the Fortified City.

The blast, which started a moment later, scattered in all directions, shaking even the city's strong walls, and sending gusts of wind through the city, hitting both the living and the dead alike.

In addition, the intense winds even cracked the great mountain that the city stood on, causing rock faces to collapse and peel off, and the falling large rocks engulfed a corner of the great fortress with a roar.

Unluckily, that location was assigned as a first aid station where injured people were brought――.

???: [――Rem! Hey, Rem!]

Rem's eyes blinked several times at the frantic voice's call.

For a moment, her thoughts skipped into white, and it took her a while to figure out what had happened.

But she soon realized that it was Katya's voice calling frantically to her and remembered that the relief station had been involved in a collapse caused by falling rocks.

Seeing cracks in the walls and ceiling, Rem quickly pushed Katya out of the way and the collapse.

And yet――,

Rem: [I am alive…?]

Katya: [Of course you're alive! You really shouldn't have done that! If you die protecting me, my heart will really die this time…]

Katya's tearful voice was heard by Rem as she was buried in the rubble and confirmed to herself that she was still alive. That powerful grief was interrupted by the sight of Rem pushing away the rubble on top of her body.

Rem seemed to be surprised, because the debris on top of her was quite heavy, and even with Rem's strength, which was that of the Oni Clan, it should have been too heavy to be easily moved.

Yet, Rem was able to do it.

Katya: [Re, Rem, your… eye!]

Pointing at Rem's face, Katya let out a shrill, high-pitched scream.

Rem could guess that Katya was pointing to her left eye, which probably had a blaze lit in it. Rem knew that Katya was pointing at her left eye, because Katya's left eye also had a flame lit there.

――No, it was not just Rem and Katya.

All of those in the aid station, except Rem and Katya, who were caught in the collapse, stood up with only minor scratches and no serious injuries.

She could see a flickering flame in one eye of everyone of them.

The power that came from that flame, brought forth strength to Rem.

And that was because――,

Rem: [――Priscilla-sama?]

Rem muttered to herself as she felt the heat of the painless flame in her eye.

Unsure. Rem was not even sure why. But Rem followed her heart and was certain of who it was that had brought that flame.

Rem: [Katya-san.]

Katya: [What, What is this!? Water… Where’s some water!? Quickly, quickly, I need some water to put this out…!]

Rem: [No, I think this is a fire that should be put out. Besides.]

Katya: [Besides?]

Katya was flustered and confused. Rem stood up, found her overturned, barely broken wheelchair, lifted Katya into it, and sat her down.

Then she looked at the people in the relief station who were standing up and nodded.

Rem: [I feel like I'm being told. ――We have got to go one more step further.]

△▼△▼△▼△

――The water mirror shattered, and the crimson woman fell from the sky in a spray of droplets.

All were transfixed by her overwhelming presence, and looked up at the sky as if bathed by the setting sun.

And, of course, that held true for the Witch as well.

???: [――Priscilla Barielle!]

At this moment, there are forty-four of the Witches, Sphinx that had been manifested by dismantling the magic stone and incorporating some of the vast amount of mana due to the incomplete magic circle that had been activated.

All of them turned their palms toward the sky, and a light was created around the falling Priscilla.

But――,

Cecilus: [Don't look away, don't touch the dancing lady!]
Halibel: [I don't think so. That's a bad move.]

Not missing the moment, the transcendent's interference reduced the number from forty-four to thirty-six in one fell swoop.

Despite that, more than enough threatening light balls gathered together all at once to Priscilla. The threat is more than enough for one person. A lethal attack from all directions, it tried to capture the sun as it escaped its captivity――,

Yorna: [I'm not going to let you do that!]

With a response of parental love, the streets of the Imperial Capital shifted and moved and shot out like spears.

They blocked the blasts of light that were trying to reach Priscilla in the air, and a series of explosions and blasts painted the sky as they protected her.

Subaru: [Together, Beatrice!]
Beatrice: [No need for you to say it, I suppose!]

An amethyst glow appeared around Priscilla as she continued to fall through the blast of light. It was a disk-shaped crystal that acted as a shield to intercept the approaching ball of light, which was created by the combined efforts of both Spirit and caster to protect and defend Priscilla.

However――,

Witch: [Not yet!]

The Witch screamed with emotion, as if she were spitting blood.

Immediately afterward, the disk was struck hard and began to creak. Eventually, the cracks widened, and the disk shattered in one fell swoop.

The white-haired Witch, having done so, rose into the sky and attempted to shower life-rending light upon Priscilla, as she fell unprotected.

Spica: [Uuau!!]
Tanza: [I'm not going to let you do that!]

The blonde girl teleported from the ground and the deer girl who jumped and kicked with a force that could break the Crystal Palace struck a blow to the torso of the Witch, whom no one could see except Priscilla, at the same time.

The Witch crumpled, and the heat ray that was released missed its target.

Witch: [Catalyst: Required.]

The crumpled Witch crumbled into bits of dirt, but even that was part of the plan she spoke of.

A moment later, multiple Witches on the ground join hands with each other in perfect synchronization, which is possible because each is the same being, all to shorten the construction of a technique, generating a great storm.

It became raging water, wind, and light, that engulfed Priscilla in the sky.
 
In the next moment, Priscilla was torn to shreds, her body in a pitiful state――,

Emilia: [Icicle Line――!]

The storm of destruction exploded from within, and what appeared next was not the torn figure of Priscilla but a flower of ice that split open in the heavens to protect or adorn her.

The beautiful massive flower petals trapped the light and did not allow it to reach Priscilla.

And then there was a figure furiously approaching Priscilla from the ground, a figure that defied all the death, destruction, and demise that loomed around them.

It was――,

???: [――Princess!!]

Beneath their feet, Aldebaran rose from the ground of Imperial Capital, stretching into the sky with a distorted and misshapen pillar of stone and earth, drawing ever closer to Priscilla.

The columns rapidly grew, and the distance between the falling Priscilla and the ascending Aldebaran shrank, and shrank, and shrank, and shrank ――until the distance became zero. 

Al: [――Hk.]

On top of an unbalanced pillar, Aldebaran's outstretched right arm forcefully held Priscilla as she fell. When Priscilla was about to fall, Aldebaran secured his legs firmly at the top of the pillar, risking his life to protect Priscilla from the fall.

Priscilla's almond-shaped eyes narrowed at Aldebaran's life-or-death decisive action,

Priscilla: [Your work was for a great cause.]

When Priscilla spoke briefly, Aldebaran looked down with a feeling of satisfaction. Then he looked up, his voice trembling,

Al: [Princess, Princess, my Princess…! Finally, again… ouch!!]

Priscilla: [Nonsense. Whom belongs to you?]

Priscilla struck Aldebaran on the head with the hilt of her Yang Sword in an unbearable manner. Aldebaran crouched down as he felt the force of the blow, which threatened to dent his steel helmet. He was unable to touch the spot where he was hit, as he was supporting Priscilla with one arm.

Priscilla gave a small snicker to the pitiful Aldebaran, with a "heh",

Priscilla: [However, excellent effort for you. I bestow mine praise.]

Al: [Well, I'm very grateful and honored… Princess? Everything okay? No injuries? Did they hurt you or anything? I mean, you look so pretty for someone who was held captive.]

Priscilla: [Do not repeat your nonsense. In the first place, mine beauty is not going to change just because I have been imprisoned for a short time. Mind your tongue, Al.]

Al: [――――]

In his arms, Priscilla told him so in a stunning manner, and Aldebaran ――Al's breath caught in his throat.

Then, once again, he nodded deeply, confirming that Priscilla was indeed in front of him. At Al's reaction, Priscilla, still in his arms, looked around,

Priscilla: [Here comes the true star of the show. You shall have grand excitements.]

There reflected in Priscilla's eyes from the top of the stone pillar were the multiple figures of those who would fight in this battle, and in each one of their eye, a flame was lit.
 
The flame of Priscilla Barielle's soul blazed in the eye of those she deemed lovable.

That, of course, included――,

Al: [Princess?]

Priscilla, with Al right beside her, lifts a finger to the cheek of the helmet he wore and peeks within. ――The right eye of his face, the one he never shows to anyone but Priscilla, was lit by the same flame.

Upon seeing this, Priscilla smiled pleasantly and said,

Priscilla: [This is of no consequence. --After all, everything in this world is made for my convenience.]
