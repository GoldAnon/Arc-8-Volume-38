*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

——The entirety of her body burst into flames, turning the Witch to ash.

The awe-inspiring power of the Yang Sword that had at last been unsheathed from its veil, which had stolen her soul and whose fierce flames reduced it to naught but cinders, exceeded even Subaru’s expectations for his plan.

Subaru: [This, is the true power of the Yang Sword…]

The crimson flames killed not just the Witch in front of them, as the blaze spread to the two other bodies of the Witch. Seeing the resultant effect, Subaru could only gasp.

Up until now, there had been several situations in which Subaru had witnessed the Yang Sword being wielded, but the owner of the Yang Sword had always been Priscilla. However, in terms of Abel exceeding Priscilla as a wielder of the Yang Sword, there was no such simple answer.

The opponents that Priscilla unleashed her Yang Sword upon had always been formidable. This time the Witch—— Sphinx had been a similarly formidable enemy, and in order to defeat her Abel had made an incredible gamble.

In every battlefield, in every possible arrangement of the board, and in every crisis up until now, he had never once utilized the Yang Sword, thus for Sphinx—— or rather, for everyone it had been eliminated as a possibility.

One could not imagine the nerve required to bring such a thing to fruition.

Vincent: [You, what is with that incomprehensible expression?]

Subaru: [I’m surprised. We’ve been through so much together up until now, and I’m still easily discovering things about your personality to complain about…!]

Vincent: [And I was wondering what you were going to say… Truly, are you talking about this card which I had left unturned? If that is so, then you were also utilizing your wit to the utmost in order to create the same plan.]

Subaru: [It’s not a matter of character for me, it’s okay because it’s a result of wit and bravery and cheating. Thinking about it from the beginning there was the Lifeblood Ritual, and that time we fought Zikr-san at Guaral, then when Arakiya made her entrance, then our disagreement with Yorna-san at Chaosflame and the game of tag with Olbart and the entire time we were on the coupled dragon carriage!]

Vincent: [Yes, and?]

Subaru: [Yes, and!? Ahhh!]

With the crimson treasured sword in hand, Abel’s shameless affirmation amazed Subaru, but then in an instant the pain of his right arm which Sphinx had broken as a warning came rushing back.

As he held his broken arm with tears in his eyes, Beatrice rushed beside him with a “Subaru” and held her hand over it, using her healing magic.

And so, as Beatrice tenderly treated Subaru,

Beatrice: [No matter how many times you say it it never seems to have an effect on that man, in fact. His ability to feel guilt has probably died, I suppose. He’s the same as Roswaal, in fact.]

Subaru: [Guhhhh…!]

Beatrice: [There, that should make it feel a little better, I suppose.]

Heaping as much verbal abuse as she could upon Abel, Beatrice finished Subaru’s medical treatment.

The pain was still there, but the broken bone felt like it had been healed. It couldn’t be moved around too much, and it would take time to be completely healed, but there were other priorities.

Vincent: [Can Jamal Aurélie be saved?]

Beatrice: [As long as his life hasn’t ceased to exist, in fact. This is Betty’s duty as Subaru’s partner, I suppose.]

Leaving with these words, Beatrice jogged over to Jamal.

After defeating the first Sphinx, three more Sphinx’s had appeared, and it was Jamal who had provoked and damaged them the most.

Spica: [Uau.]

Subaru: [Ohh, Spica, you did a great job. What about your body? It doesn’t hurt anywhere?]

Spica: [Au!]

With a big nod, Spica tried to stop his worrying as she smiled. Using his hand to wipe away the dirt that was on her cheek from the cloud of dust, he gave her a head pat to reward her for her hard work.

Truly, without any doubt, this was a victory gained by everyone here doing their utmost to fulfill their duty.

That said, he could not help but acknowledge that Abel’s trump card had contributed more than anything else——

Subaru: [Still, I’m going to hold a grudge against you for the rest of my life.]

Vincent: [If you’re talking this much, then the one who proposed this must indeed be satisfied.]

No matter how reproachful the glare, he would ignore it nonchalantly.

While his cold nature was infuriating, when it came to the matter of hiding the Yang Sword and having the confidence to stick with it, he could do nothing but speak praise.

——The fact that Abel was capable of using the Yang Sword but didn’t use it in the beginning of their battle with Sphinx was something that Subaru had become aware of in this loop.

To put it plainly, it was a level of secretiveness suitable for a war criminal.

Originally, the only trump card which could have been hoped to stop the Great Disaster of the Vollachian Empire was for Subaru to combine his power with Spica’s Star Eating.

But, if Abel’s Yang Sword could reach the foundation of the souls of the undead then the story was different.

The Yang Sword and Star Eating as the two leading actors in this siege on the undead territory could be utilized as trump cards in order to defeat the Great Disaster.

Subaru: [You, having noticed this earlier, decided to join us in this group, right?]

Spica: [Uu—?]

Subaru: [You know, Spica, this sly Emperor knew that using the Yang Sword might be one of the key items in defeating the zombies. And, it was the same with Spica right? But instead, we had to whittle down the zombies by using Star Eating.]

Spica: [Aa—, aau?]

Subaru: [That’s right. We were stopping the enemy's main forces that were coming after us. And the method we used against that main force was Star Eating. After all, I didn't know what the odds were that there was another method. So, it was okay so long as Spica’s hand could reach our targets. But if you had been unable to reach them then…]

Spica: [Auaa!]

After Subaru concluded his explanation, Spica’s eyes widened and she pointed at Abel’s Yang Sword. Subaru replied “That’s right!” to Spica’s sudden comprehension and patted her head.

Alongside Spica, he looked at Abel as if he was human garbage. 

Subaru: [Look, Spica. Those are the eyes of someone with a completely twisted personality. Your personality has to be pitch-black in order to be the Emperor of Vollachia… I knew it, wouldn’t it be better to destroy Vollachia?]

Vincent: [Changing sides as soon as the enemy leader has been reduced to ash? You have chosen a terrible time to betray me.]

Beatrice: [You, don’t beg us to help save the Empire just to immediately become the head of a rebellion, I suppose…]

Though it was out of necessity, the Empire was bad for Spica’s emotional education. Abel was a prime example of this, so outside of a situation such as this he was the first person that should not be around her.

Surrounding Spica with more good and refreshing companions—— That is, to have her come into contact with girls she could imitate, such as Emilia and Rem, or Beatrice and Tanza. 

Subaru: [In that case, we need to keep her away from Otto and Roswaal as well. However… If it’s older sisters that she likes, then finding more than two would be difficult. But Garfiel would also be a good influence…]

Beatrice: [Subaru! The healing over here is almost finished, in fact!]

Subaru: [Oh. Got it!]

Following Beatrice’s voice, Subaru and the others went towards where Jamal had fallen.

But, Jamal did not raise his voice at the arrival of Subaru and the others as he was still splayed out on the ground.

Beatrice: [For now, his life isn’t in any danger, I suppose. But, any further treatment will require time, and will also take up Betty’s remaining strength, in fact.]

Subaru: [Beako’s remaining strength… Like, your remaining mana?]

Beatrice: [Indeed, I suppose… There’s an irregularity which makes it like a lavish banquet, but it would be reckless to rely on it, In fact.]

Subaru: [Irregularity…]

Hearing Beatrice’s answer, Subaru stared down at his hands.

What she had called an irregularity, the remaining mana within Subaru’s body—— As Subaru’s contracted spirit, the mana that was in Subaru became Beatrice’s remaining MP, and so in his current condition the amount of mana being lent to her could indeed be considered an irregularity.

Subaru had some ideas as to why this might be the case.

One possibility was that the connection between everyone in the Pleiades Battalion and Subaru had brought about a positive effect, another possibility was that infantilization had led to some strange occurrence in Subaru’s Gate.

But, in the latter case it was not likely that Beatrice would be able to understand it, so he felt that the former option was more likely.

Subaru: [To become stronger because of my connections with everyone, I’m the kind of guy who gets passionate from stuff like that.]

Beatrice: [Subaru…]

Subaru: [Don’t worry, Beako. No matter what, I agree that being able to use as much magic as we want probably isn’t a good thing, so we should try to conserve it as much as possible. But, if we’re backed into a corner…]

While respecting Beatrice's judgment, Subaru stared fixedly at the fallen Jamal.

Naturally, they must not abandon him as he was instrumental to their victory. However, if Jamal did not regain consciousness, someone would inevitably have to carry him.

Vincent: [For the record, I shall not carry him.]

Subaru: [You anticipated…you've been on a roll ever since you got that sword, huh. Even though you were a close match with me in that <u>cat fight</u> earlier, you were flying and bouncing around with a swoosh…isn’t it trivial for you to carry Jamal?]

Vincent: [Even if I can do it, I shall not. Now that Jamal Aurélie is down, I am the most agile one here. We are in a position of vigilance, so I cannot carry baggage.]

Subaru: [Don’t call him baggage! Fine, I get it! I will…]

Spica: [Uuau]

Angry at the unruly emperor who had given a sound argument, Subaru would attempt to carry Jamal. However, Spica slipped past him and took the initiative to pick up Jamal's body.

The image of a petite girl easily lifting an adult man was painful to watch, even though Spica herself was not putting much strain on herself.

Subaru: [Well, that's what it would look like if anyone but you were doing it. What do you think?]

Beatrice: [It’s laborious. Working hard like that.]

Subaru: [Beako’s right, this guy has no sense of guilt!]

Beatrice: [That’s what was said. …Spica, don't push yourself too hard.]

Beatrice sighed at Abel's arrogance, and Spica exclaimed, "Uu!" with a smile in response to her consideration. Actually, it was a relief that Spica didn’t seem to find Jamal heavy.

In any case, although the reality of having defeated the formidable Sphinx was gradually starting to sink in, they couldn’t be completely happy about it.

Because――,

Vincent: [――Apparently, there is already a reason to keep my hands free.]

As Abel said this, he jerked his chin towards a succession of shadows approaching the street where Subaru and the others were as if they had heard the battle with the Sphinxes earlier――the figures of the undead were spotted.

Subaru grit his teeth at what this meant and the frustrating truth of Abel's words.

And so, the undead appeared at this location in this manner.

Beatrice: [...The "Sacrament of the Immortal King" is not interrupted after defeating Sphinx, I suppose.]

Subaru: [Damn, the most direct logic that the magic would disappear if the caster was defeated seems to be wrong. Beako, this is…]

Beatrice: [Even though she was corrupted, she was created with the goal of becoming the “Witch of Greed.” Perhaps she arranged the formula so that the “Sacrament of the Immortal King” would function even in her absence. If we don't destroy the system itself, Stone's limits are still the limits of this country, I suppose.]

Subaru: [I guess that’s probably the case…]

After absorbing what Beatrice had said, Subaru's gaze turned to the northernmost part of Imperial Capital――the Crystal Palace.

That was the Sphinx's base, so it was the most appropriate location for a symbolic object to be placed. Of course, it was possible that Sphinx, who does not appreciate such romance and drama, has placed its structure elsewhere.

Vincent: [――No, there can be no mistake that it is at the Crystal Palace. Whatever the Witch's intentions, if she needed a connection to Stone, she would need to make contact with the core of the Crystal Palace…Moguro Hagane.]

Subaru: [Isn't Moguro one of the Nine Divine Generals…?]

Vencint: [Yes. He is currently sleeping in the Crystal Palace. Or, to be precise, I put the Crystal Palace to sleep.]

Subaru: [You absolutely! Later on! Better explain it to me!]

Subaru said this to Abel, who seemed to have many more secrets besides the "Yang Sword," and welcomed the decision that they definitely needed to go to the Crystal Palace.

Subaru: [――――]

To be honest, even though he knew that the core of the "Great Disaster" was in the Crystal Palace, he still wanted to check on the safety of his comrades who he had sent to other battlefields.

In particular, he wanted to check on the safety of Emilia and Tanza.

Their placement was the only part that Subaru was not able to confirm――,

???: [――What’s this, you all look like a mess. Even the Emperor-san's forehead is covered in sweat and mud, he's a surprisingly hard worker, isn't he?]

Suddenly, a black shadow descended and forcefully turned the situation upside down with a casual tone.

The figure landed between Subaru and the incoming undead, walked over to them in a casual tone, and squatted down in front of Subaru and Beatrice.

Then he laughed with a golden kiseru in his mouth and extended his folded hands.

???: [For all you hard workers… here, have a few souvenirs.]

With that said, his folded hands were opened, and a number of strange crystals the size of coins were in his large palms.

Subaru did not know what they were, but Beatrice, holding his hand, noticed.

Beatrice: [Those are Corebugs…!]

???: [Yeah. It’s those guy’s.]

Nodding calmly, the figure brought his palms together again and rubbed them together with a scrubbing motion.

In the next instant, the undead across the street let out a cry of anguish and turned to dust. ――The core that reproduced the undead was crushed, and they could no longer sustain their bodies.

It was a tall, carefree black wolf man who did it in a flash――,

Subaru: [Halibel-san!]

Halibel: [Ooh, ooh, that's such a warm welcome. I like energetic kids who can speak loudly.]

Halibel, who had been working separately, nodded at Subaru's surprised voice.

He was asked to eliminate the most important opponent in the decisive battle for the Imperial Capital ――an enemy that had to be eliminated in order for everyone to give their best performance.

The fact that he is here like this.

Halibel: [Don't worry, I've taken care of my work. I won't let lil’ Ana's face get ruined.]

Subaru: [――! That helps! Thank you! Can I ask you something else?]

Halibel: [Hmm, you're not a shy boy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, say it.]

Subaru: [I want you to go with me to the castle! I just want to leave you to cover the other kids on the way. I'll work Abel to death!]

Vincent: [Disgraceful…]

Abel grumbled something about Subaru's suggestion, which he consciously ignored.

Anyway, it is fortuitous that Halibel has accomplished his task. He was very anxious about Emilia and others, but if Halibel were willing to go, it would provide Emilia with the best benefits and flowery effect.

Subaru: [Olbart-san should be in the castle. So go to Emilia and Tanza…]

Vincent: [Hold on, Natsuki Subaru, is that a strategic decision? If that is not the case――]

Subaru: [If you agree, then say so! And it's all part of my performance!]

Subaru retorted to Abel's interjections and glared at him.

It was encouraging to have Beatrice holding Subaru's hand tightly as if she were on his side. Halibel interrupts the exchange of stern glances with a "Hold on, hold on."

He put his bladed hand in between Subaru and Abel, as if to cut the thread of the staring contest,

Halibel: [Don't be so belligerent. And as for the fight for the castle, I don't think I'm needed for it, okay?]

Subaru: [Huh?]

Subaru's eyes widen at Halibel's comment as he strokes the hair under his chin.

The Admirer turned his narrow, thread-like eyes in the direction of the gaze that sought the basis for his statement,

Halibel: [The power of love is great, is what I'm trying to say.]

And then he laughed with a face that mixed equal parts dismay and admiration.

 △▼△▼△▼△

――Unfolding before her, was an unthinkable scene. 

And yet, being unable to define if she was Yorna Mishigure or Iris, all she could do was watch as she held back the tears that threatened to distort her vision.

Yorna : [――Tanza.]

The name spun by trembling lips, belonged to the deergirl who, with a flame dwelling in one eye, and with the hem of the kimono they had picked together fluttering, confronted the fiercely surging undead swordsmen.

Far more agile and powerful than the Tanza she knew, it was a fight brimming with self-confidence.

Tanza had been a girl lacking self-confidence.

Being incredibly intelligent and capable for her young age, and yet, as if she was completely lacking, the child had too low an opinion of herself. When she had been the same age as Tanza in a true sense, she was not nearly as capable as her.

Rather, she had been a foolish child who got carried away thinking it was her duty to fulfill the job entrusted by her parents and the people of her village without burdening them, and yet had failed to notice the kindness of those around her.

Compared to her past self, Tanza was far more admirable. And now, after believing she had parted ways with Tanza in death, they had been reunited in this precarious situation.

With Prisca, the Empire, the Demon City, Tanza――and Eugard, her mind was in the greatest state of turmoil in her more than ten lifetimes. 

The only comparable instances that had come to mind, was when she had first learned that she had been reincarnated due to a curse, when she discovered that Prisca was still alive, when she reunited with Eugard, and when Tanza, still alive, had completely refused to listen to her.

Yorna: [Of late, there's been too many…]

She wanted to lament the relentless series of shocks in her current life, however the present moment was far too hectic. 

While protecting her, who, as the various emotional burdens continued, could no longer gather the will to fight; by boldly utilizing the effects of the Soul Marriage Technique as well as something else, Tanza’s back appeared imposing. 

Just how much had she gone through after they had been separated at the Demon City?

SInce arriving at Chaosflame with her sister Zoe, the one who had most closely watched over Tanza’s growth was Yorna. However, had she remained by her side, would she have become the Tanza she is now?

Someone apart from herself, had stood by Tanza, encouraged her, and made her stronger.

She could feel it within Tanza’s intense gaze, in her gait, and in the fist that slammed into the swordsman’s face. 

Emilia: [Tanza-chan!]

Tanza: [Yes, Emilia-sama, let us not give any leeway.]

Was it that silver haired girl who had come flying backwards?

Her long hair danced, as she repelled an undead swordsman with the weapon of ice she wielded, demonstrating excellent compatibility with Tanza in providing offensive and defensive support.

Not just the silver-haired girl, but also because of the surprising strength that Tanza showed, the blue-haired swordsmen――the Undead Swordmasters, were crushed one after another, scattering onto the surroundings as fragments. 

However――,

Undead Swordmaster: [Ah, ah, ah, alas, there exists a limit for the living. Ya wield yer power with great vigor, but how long do ya expect that power to last?]

Emilia: [Geez! Don’t brag when you’re cheating!]

The silver-haired girl took up the challenge of the Corpse Swordmaster who was smiling provocatively, his golden eyes that were characteristic to the undead shining.

She raised both hands and slammed them hard on the ground, and in the next moment, ice akin to branches expanded across the street while avoiding the girl and Tanza, entrapping the hands, legs and torso of the swordsmen.

――That ice, had an appearance akin to an ivy of thorns.

Yorna: [――Ugh.]

Tanza: [Yorna-sama!]

For a moment, she felt an ache in her chest, clutching which she crouched down.  

Having caught sight of that foolish action of her’s out of the corner of her eye, Tanza cried out her name in a scream. Which meant that, albeit momentarily, Tanza’s awareness had left the battlefield.  

Corpse Swordmaster: [In order to win ya have to be greedy.]

Tanza: [――Hk!]

A fierce font kick was unleashed, sending Tanza’s petite frame flying backwards.

Her sprung up body flew, and ahead on its path was Yorna’s crouching figure. She immediately raised her face, wanting to call out Tanza’s name, but what would that even achieve?

Once again, it would merely be a meaningless tug at her awareness.

Yorna: [――Tanza.]

Tanza: [Yes, Yorna-sama]

Responding to the cry that Yorna could not hold back, Tanza adjusted her posture mid-air. Just prior to colliding, she managed to stop herself, with her small yet imposing back right before Yorna.

There, the Corpse Swordmaster’s merciless sword strike drew near, threatening to cut them both in half――,

Tanza: [――Emilia-sama!]

Emilia: [Yes!]

Not faltering for even a moment, the girl responded to the call, and Tanza swung her leg upwards.

That raised foot――which had been clad in a geta made of ice, took the strike from the Corpse Swordmaster head on.

They were thick-soled geta, just like the ones worn by The Flamboyant Yorna Mishigure.

Tanza: [YA, AAAAAHH――!!]

Tanza, having stopped the sword with the sole of the geta adorning her raised foot, lept upwards using the same raised foot as a starting point and spun vertically in mid-air――the icy geta of the opposite foot was then slammed down onto the head of the immobilized Corpse Swordmaster, driving it into the ground.

Immediately, the head of the undead dropped to the ground, collapsing the street and forming a crater of nearly five meters around it, the powerful blow turning her opponent into dust as Tanza flipped the hem of her kimono. 

Yorna: [――――]

At Tanza’s captivating appearance, all she could do was stare speechlessly. Noticing her gaze, Tanza turned around, slightly lowered the corners of her eyes, and smiled.

Those lips, they were about to call out to her saying, “Yorna”.

Emilia: [――hk, NO!]

In an instant, the silver-haired girl standing nearby had thrust out both hands, and with the air screaming as it froze, she sensed the presence of the two Corpse Swordmasters behind her being pierced by ice and turning into ice statues.

However, to the girl, words of gratitude could not be spoken.

More importantly, behind Tanza who had turned around, another Corpse Swordmaster had appeared, and his barbaric act needed to be stopped――No, she would not make it in time. Then, Tanza must be protected.

Yorna: [I…!]

Many were the things she had overlooked, many were the things she had missed out on, many were the people she had disappointed, and many were the lives upon whose shoulders she had come thus far.

Although thus far she had been unable to repay even a single one among the many, Tanza was the one she could. 

Yorna: [――――]

Resolute, she reached out and tightly held Tanza, leaning forward with half her body to protect her from the blade.

She had moved admirably. Glad that for just this moment, she had not been trembling and unable to move.   

Now, at least with this body of hers, taller and with limbs longer than it once had been, she could protect this little darling, a beloved child of the Empire that he had so carefully protected――.

???: [――To astonish mineself thus, verily thou alone art able.]

That soft voice, as if whispered sweetly into the ear, so calm that it made the battlefield raging with the gale of swords appear still, resounded, melting her heart, as if its preparedness for death but a moment ago was a lie.

Yorna: [――――]

Before the sword strike from the Corpse Swordmaster could connect, it was halted by the treasured sword of crimson that had intervened. 

And then, with the existence that had brought it about before her eyes, she could not help but gasp.

Their reunion had been unexpected, and unintended.

She did not know whether to rejoice or to grieve, and ever since that moment, she felt like her heart had been shattered.

In the end however, that question had remained unanswered, and the present moment had arrived.

Only now, at this very moment, would it be answered clearly.

???: [Even when tensed, thine face is lovely, Mine Star.]

Yorna: [Your Excellency…Hk]

Before the man who had stated so while caressing her cheek with the hand opposite to the one that had blocked the attack――before Eugard Vollachia, with his skin as warm as when he had been alive and his eyes brimming with emotion, neither Yorna nor Iris, could contain their overwhelming love and longing for him.
